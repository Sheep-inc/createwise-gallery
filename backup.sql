He is the sole developer behind UXL Themes and has released six of them in the past year, with most landing in the last few months. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/framboise/\">Framboise</a>, his latest project, is a child theme of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/alara/\">Alara</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He promised a new design variation, child theme, or block pattern when he launched Alara. It looks like he has consistently kept things moving along. Since I last <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/alara-block-theme-promises-a-new-pattern-or-design-variation-every-week-for-the-next-year\">reviewed it a month ago</a>, the theme has gained four new patterns, bringing the total to 45. Starr has also created two new child themes for a total of three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My motivation for installing, activating, and tinkering with Framboise was twofold. First, a friend keeps asking me where all the fun WordPress themes are, and this latest outing by Starr has just enough of a weird, funky personality that it feels right up his alley. Those who want a design that shouts for visitors to step into their world could hardly go wrong with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also wanted to see what someone other than Automattic was doing with block child themes. Not many other theme-related businesses or authors have created parent themes yet, and even fewer have created children for them. If Starr keeps up his pace, he has a shot of pulling ahead of the pack, at least in sheer block theme numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like a bit of visual flair from time to time. I typically prefer to do that within the confines of a clean, minimal, and boring design. I suppose that is more of a sprinkling of flair than anything. However, Framboise&#8217;s color scheme, a pastel blue mixed with pink, has me in a cheerful mood today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am digging this about page pattern in particular when paired with the child theme&#8217;s colors:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />An about page pattern.\n\n\n\n<p>The background shape is handled via a gradient &#8212; <em>I am sticking the code for that in my toolbox</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Framboise does not add its own set of block patterns. Instead, they all live in the parent, Alara. The same is true of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/ceres/\">Ceres</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/zelia/\">Zelia</a>, the other two child themes. This is a wise decision by Starr. The more that goes into the primary project&#8217;s extensions, the more maintenance it creates over time. By keeping them all in Alara, users of each child theme benefit from a shared pool of patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the most fascinating aspects of child theming with blocks. With a few simple configuration changes, theme authors can create vastly different designs, as shown in the full-page patterns for the theme:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<img />Framboise full-page patterns.\n\n\n\n<img />Alara full-page patterns.\n\n\n\n\n<p>I have built child themes in the past with similar methods, but they were always on unsteady ground. Because WordPress had no standard design system under the hood, changes in the parent could easily break child themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With themes now using a standard <code>theme.json</code> file to control settings and most styling, child themes have some extra layer of protection against breaking changes. Plus, templates will always work because they are made of blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>theme.json</code> also makes it easy to create design variations without touching another file. While Framboise includes a custom header and footer templates, all other aspects of its design alterations are handled in one place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did not even recognize that the theme was related to Alara until I installed it and noticed the author. That is the magic of child themes, and it seems that they are finally living up to their potential now that core WordPress has standards to facilitate them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My excitement around block theming continues to grow with each new project that lands on WordPress.org. Tomorrow, I can only hope to see something new. But, for now, I think I will continue playing around with Framboise for a little longer.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 02:07:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"WPTavern: Google Abandons FLoC in Favor of New Topics API, a Replacement for Third-Party Cookies\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=128966\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:235:\"https://wptavern.com/google-abandons-floc-in-favor-of-new-topics-api-a-replacement-for-third-party-cookies?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=google-abandons-floc-in-favor-of-new-topics-api-a-replacement-for-third-party-cookies\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3704:\"<p>Google is burying <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/2021-01-privacy-sandbox/\" target=\"_blank\">FLoC</a> (Federated Learning of Cohorts) in its sea of abandoned experiments. FLoC&#8217;s proposed mechanism for replacing third-party cookies grouped people together and labeled them using machine learning. The controversial origin trial caused a group of WordPress contributors to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-contributors-propose-blocking-floc-in-core\">propose blocking it in core</a> before it was even out of the experimental stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In July 2021, Google concluded FLoC&#8217;s origin trial and removed the project from the testing phase while analyzing feedback. The company did not elaborate on why it dropped FLoC but had previously <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/google-concludes-floc-origin-trial-does-not-intend-to-share-feedback-from-participants\">stated an intention not to share any feedback from the project</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>FLoC ran in limited markets and received overwhelmingly negative feedback from the tech industry that left Google with an uphill battle to get enough buy-in to proceed. Google was not able to get any major browsers on board and Amazon, GitHub, Firefox, Vivaldi, Drupal, Joomla, DuckDuckGo, and other major tech companies and open source projects had opted to block FLoC by default.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an alternative, <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/chrome/get-know-new-topics-api-privacy-sandbox/\">Google is now proposing Topics</a>, an interest-based advertising approach, which it says was informed by community feedback from the FLoC trials:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>With Topics, your browser determines a handful of topics, like “Fitness” or “Travel &amp; Transportation,” that represent your top interests for that week based on your browsing history. Topics are kept for only three weeks and old topics are deleted. Topics are selected entirely on your device without involving any external servers, including Google servers. When you visit a participating site, Topics picks just three topics, one topic from each of the past three weeks, to share with the site and its advertising partners. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Google contends that this new system would give users more control and plans to build controls into Chrome for viewing the topics and removing irrelevant ones, as well as disabling the feature completely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Topics API would be implemented at the browser level and curated to exclude topics like gender or race, data which could be deemed sensitive. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chrome&#8217;s weighty market share would position Topics to be widely used if Google decides to move forward with it, but one hurdle with industry-wide adoption would be convincing other browsers to invest in implementing new ad tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A list of <a href=\"https://github.com/jkarlin/topics/blob/main/taxonomy_v1.md\">proposed taxonomies</a> is available on the <a href=\"https://github.com/jkarlin/topics\">Topics API GitHub repository</a>. The README file includes a technical rundown of how the API will work. It also explains <a href=\"https://github.com/jkarlin/topics#evolution-from-floc\">Topics&#8217; evolution from FLoC</a> and lists FLoC&#8217;s various deficiencies &#8211; i.e. adding too much fingerprinting data to the ecosystem, lack of transparency in the API for users, inclusion of sensitive data, among others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google plans to launch a developer trial of Topics in Chrome that will include user controls and allow  developers and the ad industry to test it. The technical details of the API are expected to change as Google gets more feedback.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 00:02:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"Akismet: How to Block a Specific IP Address from a WordPress Website\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=2249\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"https://blog.akismet.com/2022/01/26/how-to-block-a-specific-ip-address-from-a-wordpress-website/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18340:\"<p>Let’s face it: the internet isn’t always a safe place and malicious attacks can come from anywhere. But one good solution to protect your site from hacks and spam is to block malicious IP addresses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, you don’t have to be a tech whiz to protect your site. By understanding how IP addresses work and how you can manage them on your WordPress website, you can help prevent spam and secure your data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we’ll introduce you to IP addresses and cover why you might want to block some of them. We’ll also show you how to find and remove any problematic ones. Finally, we’ll share three extra ways to prevent WordPress spam.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-2249\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"an-introduction-to-ip-addresses\">An introduction to IP addresses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every single one of your users has an IP address. IP addresses are unique numbers that identify which internet connection a visitor is using. That means the address stays the same, even if the person uses a different account.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IP addresses appear as four sets of numbers divided by individual dots. For reference, here’s what the basic structure looks like, though it also might be longer and more complicated:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>123.45.678.9</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress collects this number and stores it in an access file whenever someone connects to your site. But some visitors may be using a <a href=\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/vpn-endpoint-security-clients/what-is-vpn.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Virtual Private Network (VPN)</a> to prevent this data storage. Given this possibility, it’s even more important to block any malicious IP addresses that you <em>can </em>identify.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"three-reasons-you-might-want-to-blocklist-an-ip-address\">Three reasons you might want to blocklist an IP address</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The IP addresses that access your site will be perfectly harmless most of the time. Still, there’s always a chance that you’ll want to exclude some. Here are a few reasons why you might need to blocklist an IP address on WordPress website:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-stop-spam-comments\">1. Stop spam comments</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A comments section can be a vital part of a website’s community. That’s because it offers connection: your visitors can join the conversation, interacting with your content and each other.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organic comments will typically be relevant and intelligible, like the below example:</p>\n\n\n\n<img /><em>Credit to a comments section on </em><a href=\"https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/smores-bars/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>gimmesomeoven.com</em></a><em>. </em>&nbsp;\n\n\n\n<p>The chances are good that real, well-intentioned visitors wrote these comments. Still, this won’t always be the case. Some people or bots will use the <a href=\"https://blog.akismet.com/2022/01/12/how-to-stop-comment-spam-in-wordpress/\">comments box as an opportunity for spam</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A spam comment might just be completely unrelated commentary. It might also be garbled, unintelligible, or gibberish. These types of spam can drown out real comments and make people’s experience on your website less enjoyable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, spam can cause search engines to flag your site as unsafe. So blocking the IP addresses behind spam can help preserve your search engine optimization (SEO) efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-keep-out-potential-hackers\">2. Keep out potential hackers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gibberish comments aren’t the only concern. Hackers might use comments to promote malicious links. These URLs can lead to sites designed to steal information from you and your audience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this danger isn’t limited to comments. Hackers may try to gain access to your site with repeated login attempts. These are commonly referred to as <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/features/security/brute-force-attack-protection/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">brute force attacks</a>. They usually come from one IP address, meaning that blocking that address could solve your problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, there’s also a more advanced technique where malicious actors try to inject bad code into your site. By using entry ports like your comments section or sign-up forms, they can try to trick your website into giving them access. Once they’re in, they can do some serious damage to your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-limit-access-to-authorized-users\">3. Limit access to authorized users</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A membership model is a popular way to run a website. The benefits of more engaged users and lucrative subscription models can be desirable. Still, there’s always a chance that someone tries to access an area they haven’t paid for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Membership websites aren’t the only ones who have to deal with this. Any site with user roles may need to be on alert.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a hacker might try to access an admin-only area. Once they’re in, they’ll have full access to your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In both cases, blocking the visitor’s IP address is easy. It just takes a few minutes to prevent future attempts. Overall, we recommend learning this skill no matter which kind of site you run.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-find-a-user-s-ip-address-in-wordpress\">How to find a user’s IP address in WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to block an IP address, the first step is to identify it. Here are two ways that you can uncover someone’s IP address in WordPress:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-use-the-comments-section\">1. Use the comments section</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we mentioned before, WordPress automatically stores the IP address of every visitor. Fortunately, discovering one is pretty easy — especially if the spam comes from your comments section.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start in your WordPress dashboard. Then, go to <strong>Comments</strong><em> </em>and look under the <strong>Author</strong><em> </em>column.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>From here, you can view the IP address of whoever left the comment on your WordPress website. You should see this data regardless of the post.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-check-the-cpanel-access-logs\">2. Check the cPanel access logs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can get to your website’s access logs, you can use them to check IP addresses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by going to your hosting account. Then, find the cPanel dashboard, look for the area labeled <strong>Logs,</strong> and click on <strong>Raw Access</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>From here, you’ll be able to click on your domain name and download the access logs. After extracting the records, you should be able to see the IP addresses that have tried to interact with your website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We recommend looking through this record to find any addresses that have made many requests. If you find one, chances are good that they’re malicious, and you may want to consider blocking them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-block-specific-ip-addresses-from-accessing-your-wordpress-site\">How to block specific IP addresses from accessing your WordPress site</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve discovered the IP addresses that you want to block, you have a few options for doing so. Here are four different ways to get started:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-use-the-comment-blocklist-feature\">1. Use the comment blocklist feature</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first route is arguably the easiest: using WordPress built-in features. Start by collecting the IP addresses you want to block from your WordPress website. You can single out one or compile as many as you need — it’s up to you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, all you have to do is change a few settings. Start in your WordPress dashboard, then go to <strong>Settings → Discussion</strong>. Scroll down until you find the <strong>Disallowed Comment Keys</strong><em> </em>box.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>From here, you can grab the list of addresses you made earlier and paste it into the box. Make sure that you only include one IP address per line. Now, anytime someone with that IP address tries to leave a comment, it will go directly into the trash. Keep in mind that this method still allows the person or bot to access your site, just not post any comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This setting serves two main purposes. For one thing, it can cut down on your workload. You won’t have to worry about assessing a massive amount of comments that you already know are spam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, this setting also helps protect your visitors. That’s because it doesn’t matter what type of spam that IP address is trying to leave — whether it’s gibberish or malicious links — every single message will be blocked.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-use-a-plugin-to-block-entire-countries\">2. Use a plugin to block entire countries</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you see that most IP addresses are coming from a specific country, the above method may not work for you. It would require you to constantly monitor your comments and add to a seemingly never-ending list of blocked users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, you can opt to block an entire country. This setup may end up being less work, especially when you use a plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/iq-block-country/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">iQ Block Country</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by adding the plugin to your website. After you’ve activated it, you should get an alert asking you to upload a database file. To access this file, you’ll need to sign up for an account on the <a href=\"https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MaxMind website</a>. Don’t worry — it’s all free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you’ve logged in, you can go to <strong>Database Products and Subscriptions → Download Databases</strong>. Find the <strong>Country Database</strong><em> </em>and download it. Then, extract the file and upload it using a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/ftp-clients/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve completed the upload, go back to the iQ Block Country plugin. Choose whether you want to block addresses from your site’s front or back end. You can also select both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Navigate to the tab for the area you want to restrict. Then, select the country you wish to exclude. If you’re going to choose several, hold down the <em>ctrl </em>key while selecting. Finally, save your work. Your website should now ban any IP addresses from your selected countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This method is only recommended if you are certain that all traffic from a specific country will try to negatively influence your website. If you have genuine traffic from those countries, you might want to find <a href=\"https://blog.akismet.com/2022/01/12/how-to-stop-comment-spam-in-wordpress/\">an alternative method to block spam</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-edit-your-htaccess-file\">3. Edit your .htaccess<em> </em>file</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another option is to edit your <em>.htaccess</em> file directly. If you don’t want to get too involved in your website’s code, you may want to choose another option. A single mistake or edit could potentially break your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re confident in your ability to edit files, you can use this method as a fast way to ban IP addresses. Nevertheless, we still recommend <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2021/11/11/how-to-back-up-your-wordpress-site/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">backing up your site</a> beforehand if something goes wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gather the IP addresses that you want to ban. Then, log in to your site using your FTP client of choice. Once you’re in, look for your website’s root folder. It’s most likely named after your domain or called <em>public_html.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open that folder and find the file named <em>.htaccess</em>. Note that the .<em>htaccess</em> file could be hidden and, depending on the FTP client you use, you’ll need to turn on the option for <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/filezilla-show-hidden-files/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">showing hidden files.</a> Then, use a text editor to open it. Scroll down to the very bottom of the file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’re there, paste the following code:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\">\nOrder Allow,Deny\nAllow from all\nDeny from 111.222.333.444\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Remember to replace the example IP address with the one you want to block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to block more than one address, repeat the final line with the new IP address. Remember to save your work before exiting the file. Now, those specific IP addresses should be denied access to your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a chance that an error in the process breaks your site. Make sure it’s working properly and, if there are any issues, <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2021/11/30/how-to-restore-a-wordpress-website-from-a-backup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">restore an earlier backup</a> before going any further.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"4-use-cpanel\">4. Use cPanel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This method might be particularly convenient if you already use cPanel to discover which IP addresses you want to ban.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start at the cPanel dashboard for your hosting account. Then, scroll down to the <strong>Security</strong><em> </em>section and select <strong>IP Blocker</strong><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>From there, fill in the fields with the IP addresses you’re trying to prevent. After you save your work, your hosting provider should block those visitors from your WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-remove-banned-ip-addresses\">How to remove banned IP addresses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Everybody makes mistakes. Whether you mistyped an IP address or misjudged it as spam, you may need to undo your work. Fortunately, it’s a fairly simple process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exact steps will vary depending on which blocking method you chose in the first place. However, the process mostly involves reversing the steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Undo the blocklist method: </strong>Return to your WordPress dashboard and delete the IP addresses you want to unblock.</li><li><strong>Undo the iQ Block Country method</strong>: Return to the plugin settings and remove the chosen countries or disable the plugin altogether.</li><li><strong>Undo the </strong><strong><em>.htaccess </em></strong><strong>file method: </strong>Reopen your <em>.htaccess </em>file and delete the code you added.</li><li><strong>Undo the cPanel method</strong>: Return to your hosting dashboard’s IP Blocker tool and remove your chosen addresses from the list.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, it only takes a few steps to undo this work. However, that time can start to add up if you have a ton of blocked IP addresses. Because of this, we recommend that you carefully pick the ones you want to exclude before going through the process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"two-extra-tips-to-prevent-spam-on-your-wordpress-website\">Two extra tips to prevent spam on your WordPress website</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Blocking IP addresses can be a powerful way to prevent spam. However, it’s not your only option. Here are two more ways you can prevent spam:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-filter-out-contact-form-spam\">1. Filter out contact form spam</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Spam can come from more than just comment forms. If you have a contact form on your website, you’ve probably already noticed some malicious submissions. That’s why we recommend spending time on this area of your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to filter this spam is by <a href=\"https://blog.akismet.com/2021/12/23/do-captcha-and-recaptcha-protect-wordpress-sites-from-bots/\">adding a reCAPTCHA checkbox</a>. Google offers this tool for free. It’s a Turing test: humans can complete it, but bots can’t.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding a reCAPTCHA checkbox to your contact form is a simple way to cut out a large number of junk entries.</p>\n\n\n\n<img /><em>Photo © </em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Google</em></a>.\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re running a membership site with different user access roles, you might also choose to only show the contact form to certain members. Even restricting access to logged-in users can decrease the amount of spam you have to deal with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But an even more effective way to <a href=\"https://blog.akismet.com/2021/12/29/how-to-stop-contact-form-spam-on-wordpress/\">prevent contact form spam</a> is to use <a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">Akismet</a>. It automatically blocks spam form submissions so you never even have to deal with them. And, thanks to an advanced list of IP addresses and spam characteristics, it knows exactly what to watch out for. And it works without a reCAPTCHA, so it’s one less thing for real visitors to deal with.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-detect-misleading-links\">2. Detect misleading links</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another option is to keep a close eye on the links that appear on your site. Unfortunately, you probably can’t monitor every URL. That’s why we recommend using Akismet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet monitors all of your comments for spam signals and characteristics, like phishy links. It can automatically detect malicious URLs and block those comments from appearing on your site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, if you want to go the extra mile, you can also automatically block all comments that contain a link —&nbsp;or a certain number of links —&nbsp;from your site using WordPress default settings. Simply go to <strong>Settings → Discussion </strong>in your WordPress dashboard. Then, in the <strong>Comment moderation </strong>section, change the line that says, <strong>“Hold a comment in the queue if it contains&nbsp;2 or more links”</strong> to one link.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-ips-and-eliminate-spam\">Block IPs and eliminate spam</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Spam can bog down any website. As more malicious actors try to access yours, you could be looking at a serious problem. Fortunately, blocking IP addresses is a quick and simple way to help keep your site safe from known spammers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we introduced you to an IP address and covered a few reasons why you might want to block one. We also showed you four ways to do so. Finally, we provided a couple extra methods to keep your site spam free.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 22:45:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Rob Pugh\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"Akismet: How to Stop User Spam Registrations in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=2234\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://blog.akismet.com/2022/01/26/how-to-stop-user-spam-registrations-in-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17803:\"<p>Offering a user registration feature on your website can be a great way to generate leads and encourage brand loyalty. On the other hand, it can also make your site vulnerable to spam registrations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, there are ways to reap the benefits of registrations without opening your site to bad-faith users. By taking some simple precautions, you can block bots and hackers from creating accounts and accessing your WordPress dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, we’ll discuss why user registration spam can damage your site. We’ll then share eight ways to stop these unwanted signups.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-2234\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-user-registration-spam\">What is user registration spam?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>User registration spam occurs when unwanted users register for an account for purposes other than what you intended. They may do so to post malicious comments or even gain access to your dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While many know that <a href=\"https://blog.akismet.com/2020/07/06/akismet-five-hundred-billion-with-a-b-spam/\">spam is a huge problem</a> for almost all websites, unwanted user registrations is a kind of spam that’s often overlooked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you allow people to create an account, WordPress’ default registration form is located at <em><a href=\"https://example.com/wp-login.php?action=register\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://example.com/wp-login.php?action=register</a></em>. From there anyone can choose a username, enter an email address, and create an account.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, malicious third-parties and bots can use this to create spam accounts. They can just append the same URL to any WordPress domain, enter a bit of information, and create an account — it’s that simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"why-do-spammers-register-on-a-website\">Why do spammers register on a website?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once registered on your site, they can start spreading more spam. This may include posting comments that contain malicious links or self-promotion, which can instantly make your site appear less professional. Junk comments are notorious for damaging the visitor experience, and may even negatively <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2020/01/02/comment-spam-google-cares/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">impact your Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on how you handle registrations, these spam accounts might even have elevated privileges. This can include everything from moderating your site’s comments, to creating new posts, or even accessing your dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a spammer manages to reach the WordPress dashboard, the results could be disastrous. Spammers typically want to spread more spam, but in the worst case scenario they may use this elevated access to launch more sophisticated attacks. This might include deleting your content, stealing your data, or even installing dangerous software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-stop-user-spam-registrations-in-wordpress\">How to stop user spam registrations in WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hackers and bots are constantly coming up with new techniques for spam registration. For this reason, we recommend using multiple anti-spam strategies simultaneously. This can give you the best chance of catching spambots and malicious third parties. With that in mind, here are eight ways to stop user spam registrations in WordPress:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-disable-user-registrations\">1. Disable user registrations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>User registrations can benefit your site in lots of different ways. Often, they can be the first step towards monetizing your content. Free registration can also be a great way to generate leads or build a mailing list.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet not every website requires user registration. If you run a personal blog or business website, you may not necessarily need to offer this feature.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on your goal, there may be alternative, safer ways to achieve the same results. For example, if you’re planning to use registration as a lead generation tool, you could <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/jetpack-blocks/form-block/newsletter-sign-up-form/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">create a newsletter</a> or <a href=\"https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/tips-tricks/how-to-allow-your-website-visitors-to-request-a-callback\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a callback request form</a> instead. Both of these techniques can generate leads without exposing your site to user spam registrations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also possible to accept guest submissions without registration. If you want to feature guest posts on your site, you could use a plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-submitted-posts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">User Submitted Posts</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disabling user registration isn’t appropriate for every website. For membership sites, forums, and eCommerce sites, user registration is a must-have, and the benefits far outweigh the negatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do decide to disable registration, navigate to <strong>Settings → General</strong> in your WordPress dashboard. Then find the <strong>Membership</strong> setting and deselect <strong>Anyone can register</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Now, no one can register on your WordPress website. This includes those pesky spambots!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-change-the-wordpress-registration-url\">2. Change the WordPress registration URL</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, all WordPress registration pages are located at /<em>wp-login.php?action=register</em>. This makes it easy for automated scripts and bots to access your site’s signup form. From there, they can create hundreds or even thousands of spam accounts, and flood your site with unwanted content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can reduce this bot-based traffic by changing your registration page URL. Human attackers will still be able to access this form, but an obscure URL can make it virtually impossible for spam bots to attack your site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind the scenes, the user registration form is actually part of the WordPress login page. This means you can use any plugin that alters the login URL, like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wps-hide-login/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WPS Hide Login</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After installing and activating this plugin, navigate to <strong>Settings → WPS Hide Login</strong>. You can now enter your new URL. To really make life difficult for the bots, try to opt for an address that isn’t easy to guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on how your site is set up, you may need to update any links, menus, or other content that points to your old registration page URL.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-perform-email-verification\">3. Perform email verification&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every time someone tries to register with your site, you can send an email to the address they provided. The user can then open this email and perform a verification task, like clicking on a link. In this way, email verification can prevent bot-based spam, and will even stop human spammers from registering using fake contact information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drawback is that email verification does add another step to the registration process. To drive conversions, it’s smart to make registration as smooth as possible, and email verification adds friction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that email verification is widely used by many websites. Most internet users are familiar with this technique, and will accept it as a necessary part of creating an account.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, WordPress doesn’t support email verification. But you can add this functionality using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-verification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">User Verification plugin</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After installing and activating this plugin, navigate to <strong>Users → User Verification</strong>. You can then set <strong>Enable email verification</strong> to <strong>Yes</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>You can also configure some additional options, like choosing the page where users will be redirected following a successful verification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This plugin also comes with built-in templates that you can use for your verification emails. To take a closer look, click on the <strong>Email Templates</strong> tab.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>You can now explore the various templates and make any desired changes. Once you’ve finished, scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on <strong>Save Changes</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"4-require-admin-approval-for-new-registrations\">4. Require admin approval for new registrations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to stop spammers in their tracks is to review each registration. This is a manual process, so if your site receives a large number of signups this can quickly become a time-consuming and frustrating task for your WordPress admin team. For this reason, manual approval is only appropriate for websites that receive a small number of registrations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also want to opt for this method if you’re highly selective about who can register on your site. For example, if you’re running a private company portal for employees only, it may make sense to review each registration manually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve weighed the pros and cons and decided that manual approval is the preferred way to handle user registrations, you can add this functionality using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/new-user-approve/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">New User Approve</a> plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin works out of the box, so there are no settings for you to configure. As soon as you activate this plugin, it will add an admin approval notification to your registration form.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever a user completes the registration form, you&#8217;ll receive a notification via email. You can then review the submission by navigating to <strong>Approve New Users → Pending New Users.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"5-add-a-captcha-field\">5. Add a CAPTCHA field</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A CAPTCHA is a puzzle or challenge that visitors must solve in order to register with your site. These can be an easy way to differentiate between genuine registrations and bots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.akismet.com/2021/12/23/do-captcha-and-recaptcha-protect-wordpress-sites-from-bots/\">CAPTCHAs may be effective</a>, but they’re not particularly popular with internet users. There’s even evidence to suggest that CAPTCHAs may reduce your conversion rates by <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/burszstein_2010_captcha.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">up to 40 percent</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do add a CAPTCHA to your registration page, you should ensure that the challenge is easy to solve. You may also want to review your registration process to make sure it’s as painless as possible — even with the addition of a CAPTCHA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should consider that users with visual impairments may find it more difficult to complete certain CAPTCHAs. In particular, we recommend avoiding picture-based puzzles, and opting for text-based challenges wherever possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Contact Form 7</a> plugin for your registration form, you can add a CAPTCHA using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-captcha/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Really Simple CAPTCHA</a> plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also add an easy, text-based CAPTCHA to your login form using <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-login-captcha/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Simple Login Captcha</a>. This may not prevent spammers from registering with your site, but it will prevent bots and automated scripts from accessing their new accounts. In this way, Simple Login Captcha can minimize the damage that spammers can inflict on your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"6-opt-for-google-s-recaptcha\">6. Opt for Google’s reCAPTCHA</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to weeding out the bots, CAPTCHA isn’t your only option. In 2014, Google released <a href=\"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/v3.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA</a>, which simply requires visitors to select an <em>I’m not a robot</em> checkbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is much faster and easier compared to CAPTCHA’s picture-based challenges. It’s also accessible to a wider range of users, particularly people with visual impairments who might be accessing your site using a screen reader.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to know that there are <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90369697/googles-new-recaptcha-has-a-dark-side\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">privacy concerns</a> surrounding Google’s reCAPTCHA. In particular, some researchers have theorized that Google may be using cookies to determine whether you&#8217;re a human or a bot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can add a reCAPTCHA checkbox to your site using a plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-captcha/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reCaptcha by BestWebSoft</a>. This plugin has additional features that can make the reCAPTCHA authentication less intrusive, including hiding the reCAPTCHA field for whitelisted IP addresses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After installing and activating this plugin, navigate to <strong>reCaptcha → Settings</strong>. In the <strong>General</strong><em> </em>section, you can choose which version of reCaptcha you want to use:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Version 2 simply requires visitors to click on a checkbox. Google then determines whether they’re a bot using advanced risk analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Version 3, you can either use a checkbox or opt for invisible CAPTCHA. The latter distinguishes between legitimate users and bots by running a script in the background. Since the visitor doesn’t need to manually select a checkbox, this enables you to guard against spammers without affecting the visitor experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final option is “Invisible”. As the name suggests, this setting evaluates the visitor by running an unobtrusive script. Once again, this promises to minimize spam signups without adding friction to the registration experience. After making your selection, you’ll need to generate a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create#list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">site key and secret key</a>, and follow the instructions from Google to configure your reCAPTCHA.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"7-use-a-geolocation-plugin\">7. Use a geolocation plugin</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some websites have a strong connection to a particular location. This includes online stores that only ship to specific countries and websites that specialize in local news. In this scenario, it’s unlikely that someone outside of these areas will need to register.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this is the case, you may want to detect each visitor’s whereabouts using a geolocation plugin. You can then grant or deny access to your WordPress registration form based on their current location.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can minimize user spam registrations on your WordPress website. At the same time, it may also prevent some legitimate users from registering with your site. There are always going to be special cases where someone may want to create an account from an unexpected location. For example, someone may try to register with your European-based online store while on holiday in America.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before enabling geolocation, it’s smart to examine your traffic using a tool like <a href=\"https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Analytics</a>. By evaluating where your visitors originate from, you can identify areas that you may be able to blocklist without losing out on conversions.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>You can restrict access to your registration page using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/ip2location-redirection/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IP2Location Redirection</a> plugin. Unlike some other geolocation plugins, IP2Location enables you to redirect the visitors to an alternative web page depending on their location.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can improve the experience for any legitimate visitors who may attempt to register from a blocklisted country. After activating this plugin, select <strong>Redirection</strong> in the left-hand menu. It will then ask you to complete a registration process in order to generate a download key. After inputting this key into the WordPress dashboard, navigate to <strong>Redirection → Rules</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>In the <strong>From</strong><em> </em>field, you can either block access to your registration page or your entire website. Then you can specify all of the locations that you want to block.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"protect-your-registration-forms\">Protect your registration forms</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many websites use registrations to monetize their content, generate leads, and build relationships with their visitors. But it isn’t all positive! WordPress user spam registrations can flood your database with junk and even put your site at risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you could simply disable user registrations, this isn’t appropriate for all websites. Fortunately, there are plenty of plugins you can use to offer this functionality safely. This includes performing email verification via the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-verification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">User Verification plugin</a> and adding your choice of visible or invisible reCAPTCHA using <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-captcha/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reCaptcha by BestWebSoft</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 15:02:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Simon Keating\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"Post Status: WP Career Summit News\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=92839\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-career-summit-news/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4285:\"<p><strong><a href=\"https://wpcareersummit.com\">The site is live</a>!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Call for Speakers is live!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Call for Sponsors is live!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Registration is open!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first ever WordPress Career Summit is scheduled for Friday, April 8, 9am-5pm CDT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we have planned:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>7 sessions for Job Seekers</li><li>7 sessions for Employers</li><li>Interactive rooms for Sponsors</li><li>Recorded commercials for Sponsors</li><li>Speaking opportunities</li><li>A Job Fair</li><li>Networking opportunities</li><li>Lots of guidance and instruction!</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"opportunities-for-sponsors\">Opportunities for Sponsors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are only 12 sponsor spots, so act early if you\'d like to sponsor this event.

I would start with the culture of the city I was born in “Lake city Udaipur” located in the state of Rajasthan. It’s a beautiful city with a sparkling culture but also a bit of rigidness about girls&#8217; education. But unlike the societal mentally my parents were the biggest supporters for my education and not only the schooling but till the graduation. With their support and encouragement I completed my graduation in Computer Science Engineering</p>\n<p>After completing my graduation I was able to secure employment at Bosch.</p>\n<p>But later on I ended my journey at Bosch and joined the Ideabox as a QA in my home town Udaipur.</p>\n<h2>How I started my WordPress Journey</h2>\n<p>I started my career/journey with WordPress back in the year 2015. During the time of my graduation I came to know about WordPress but didn’t have much information about the operations of it but I was excited to learn new technology and luckily a couple of years later I got a chance to work as WordPress Quality Analyst. And my Journey with WordPress began with it.</p>\n<p>When I started working as a Quality Analyst I was able to explore WordPress and take a deep dive into it. From that moment, I decided to make it an integral part of my ever learning professional career.</p>\n<p>WordPress is not just a tool that can be used to simplify website building, but also a platform where you can meet new people, share your thoughts, learn from them and improve yourself through the process.</p>\n<p>When I first started out, I had many questions in mind, some really basic ones too, like.</p>\n<p>What are Themes &amp; Plugins ?</p>\n<p>Who developed WordPress ?</p>\n<p>What is WordCamp ?</p>\n<p>It’s the same time where I thought maybe I’ll contribute to WordPress one day.</p>\n<h2>Becoming A Contributor</h2>\n<p>I started contributing to WordPress in 2015 with Theme Review. Where I got a chance to work with WordPress code experts and at the same time I learned concepts of theme development. It was a great opportunity for me to learn and improve my development skills. As I was very much interested in testing from the beginning, I did the same in WordPress and contributed to Core.</p>\n<p>My first contribution was in WordPress 4.7 and I remember the day when I first saw my name in the WordPress contributor list. This thing encourages me to make more contributions towards WordPress. I continued my contribution in all WordPress core updates and am happy to be a part of the community.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image2.png\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Then I thought of translating WordPress in my native language Hindi. From there, I started contributing to Translation and became GTE (General Translation Editor) of the Hindi project.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image4.png\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Then we organized WordCamp Udaipur 2017, and it helped me to connect to new people, and I got to know many people already working on WordPress. This was my first WordCamp, and the experience was superb. It gave me a chance to share my WordPress contribution journey with all members and I participated as a Panelist. It was a great moment for me when I was speaking in front of hundreds of people and everyone cherished my journey. It inspired me to continue my contribution to another team like Meta, Support WordPress TV.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image3.png\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>I was very crazy to get new badges on my profile and these things redirect me in all directions.</p>\n<h2>Big Changes</h2>\n<p>In 2019 my life revamped when I got married and with the support and guidance of my life partner, I took a new step in my life and joined Brainstorm Force. where I got a chance to work on WordPress top most product and learned many things from designing to marketing.</p>\n<p>In November 2019 Josepha Haden sent out a call for an all-women release squad. I’ve always felt that not enough women take part in WordPress, so I decided to jump in.</p>\n<p>We talked, and I got on board as the <strong>Test Lead</strong>. It’s been a wonderful journey— worth every second and this was a proud moment for me when I saw my name on the WordPress Noteworthy list . You feel proud when you see your small contributions used by 40% of the web.</p>\n<p>As a test lead, my first priority was to ensure that the release would be stable and more importantly, ready for production sites. To effectively manage all the testing, we decided to run test scrubs every week, and talk about the testing areas to get the entire team involved.</p>\n<p>We initiated the first test scrub on 29th September and we got a great response from everyone. So, we continued to run the scrub every week and also picked up tickets that needed an immediate resolution.</p>\n<p>I continued my role in WordPress 5.7 as well. This was the moment where I met with new people and got a chance to look into WordPress core release.</p>\n<p>This is how I improved my skills and got the chance to work on the core release of WordPress 5.6 &amp; WordPress 5.7.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image1.png\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image5.png\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Skills you have with yourself will eventually fade away unless and until you start working on them and sharpen it. so don’t underestimate the value of any skill. It will eventually help you somehow in your career.</p>\n<p><strong><i>“Believe in Yourself and achieve Success.”</i></strong></p>\n<p>To get something new you have to stop doing something old, and I got the chance to work on WordPress top product MemberPress. In October 2021, I joined Caseproof LLC, a company that specializes in producing WordPress plugins and services for online businesses.</p>\n<p>It’s not difficult to manage personal &amp; Professional life if you have dedication towards the work and I am really enjoying my work with personal life.</p>\n<h2>What’s next ?</h2>\n<p>There is no chance that I’ll stop working with WordPress. I would love to continue working with the community and help more people get involved in WordPress. It is true that many people are working on WordPress, but they don’t know much about contribution. Therefore, my future goal is to help people (especially women) contribute more to WordPress and take this platform on a large scale. I’ll try to be a part of more local and International WordCamp &amp; Meetups.</p>\n<p>So get involved with WordPress and you will eventually evolve.</p>\n<p>Thank you Topher and HeroPress team for giving me a chance to share my experience.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 02:00:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Monika Rao\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:118:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.9 “Josephine” Released, Introduces Full Site Editing and New Twenty Twenty-Two Default Theme\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=126378\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:267:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-9-josephine-released-introduces-full-site-editing-and-new-twenty-twenty-two-default-theme?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-5-9-josephine-released-introduces-full-site-editing-and-new-twenty-twenty-two-default-theme\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3820:\"<p>After a short delay, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/01/josephine/\">WordPress 5.9 &#8220;Josephine&#8221;</a> has finally arrived with the long-awaited full-site editing features that give users more control over site design and page templates. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release is named for American-born jazz singer Joséphine Baker, who found success on broadway before moving to Europe and becoming very popular in France.  She frequently made her way back the US in the 1950&#8217;s to advocate for the Civil Rights Movement, participating in demonstrations and boycotting segregated venues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many years, non-technical WordPress users were told to stay away from the Theme Editor menu and were warned that changes made there could make their sites inoperable. A new era in WordPress theme editing has dawned with the debut of the new template editor. It allows users to manipulate templates (home, single post, etc) and template parts (headers, footers, etc) with a visual interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Appearance &gt; Editor (beta) &gt; Site\n\n\n\n<p>For block themes, the new Site Editor and Styles interface has replaced the Customizer. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/styles-overview/\">Styles</a> lets users customize their sites with different colors, typography, and layouts, as well as give blocks a more unifying appearance.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"twenty-twenty-two-a-new-default-theme-for-building-beautiful-block-based-websites\">Twenty Twenty-Two: A New Default Theme for Building Beautiful Block-based Websites</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentytwo/\">Twenty Twenty-Two</a> is bundled in WordPress 5.9 as the first ever block-based default theme. It comes with a collection of pre-designed color palettes and a beautiful <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/files/2021/10/Example-Layouts-scaled.jpg\">array of patterns</a> for all kinds of creative combinations. Twenty Twenty-Two was built to showcase full-site editing features, so the layout of every page can be completely customized, making it a truly multipurpose theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"a-new-navigation-block\">A New Navigation Block</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.9 introduces block-based site navigation.

For months, I have considered building a single-page profile/card theme, and I finally sat down and put in the work over the weekend. In part, I just wanted to do this for fun. However, another part of me wanted to see how block theming has progressed from a developer perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspiration for this theme came from a few other people and projects. Kjell Reigstad&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/carrd-like-theme-experiment-provides-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-theming\">two-column landing page experiment</a> from October 2020 first triggered it. A recent question to the Ask the Bartender column about <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/ask-the-bartender-are-there-any-compact-and-personal-block-themes\">compact-and-cozy themes</a> got my creative juices flowing again. However, seeing the Themes Team approve a similar block theme, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/miniblock-ooak/\">Miniblock OOAK</a>, by Carolina Nymark meant that the rules were now lax enough to possibly put something like this out into the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the problems is that block-based theming has burned me before. I spent months building a new project last year in my precious free time only to have Gutenberg plugin updates wipe out my progress weeks later. I knew things could change with the unstable foundation of alpha-level software, but it was still deflating. Needless to say, I could never find the motivation to pick it back up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With WordPress 5.9 and a more stable block-theming system just mere days ahead, it was time to give it another shot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to <em>learn block theming deeply</em>. The only way I could do that was to go back to the beginning. I needed to reacquaint myself with those foundational elements of plain ol&#8217; HTML, CSS, and PHP. And forget everything I thought I knew building on top of the modern web. I needed to become a <em>noob</em> again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically, it is impossible to forget everything I know without incurring some sort of amnesia. However, maybe &#8212; <em>just maybe</em> &#8212; I could get back to the building blocks of the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could I spin up a WordPress theme without a complex web of dependencies spanning over 900 projects in my <code>/node_modules</code> folder?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could I create something without dutifully pulling in my base PHP scripts via Composer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could I, <em>you know</em>, just build a WordPress theme?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step was to check my ego at the door. When I set aside years of modern tooling and a workflow built around them, what I found was a beautifully-simple theming system that pays homage to WordPress&#8217;s roots but is flexible enough to extend for advanced builds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not to say that there were no hiccups along the way, but we hear about those enough. Plus, I consider programming/development to be the art of solving problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a restless weekend. I got four, maybe five, hours of solid sleep between Friday and Saturday night. Perhaps I had so many projects and things going on that my mind could not shut them out. Regardless, I was back awake at 3:30am on Sunday morning, tired but unable to catch those much-needed Z&#8217;s. So, I cracked open my code editor and created a new theme project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within an hour, it was working. It was in decent enough shape to share with friends over Twitter in two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following is a screenshot of the current homepage. Technically, it is the only page. I have tinkered a bit since I pushed my first commits live.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />One-page profile card theme.\n\n\n\n<p>This is a block pattern named &#8220;Reflections.&#8221; The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/photos/photo/32661ecf00/\">mountain reflecting on the lake photo</a> is from WordPress Photos and shot by Anne McCarthy. The gradient used for the background is a reflection of the image&#8217;s colors too, which I thought was a nice touch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme includes several other patterns. The goal is to allow users to pick their favorite for their profile card, customize the content, and save. <em>Easy peasy.</em> I hit a snag with this, which I dive into at the end of the post. For the most part, everything went well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-i-learned-from-the-experience\">What I Learned from the Experience</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Creating WordPress themes with blocks is easy. Most things are structured and play by a standard set of rules. Templates go here. Parts go there. Plug in your settings over yonder. We are likely to see even more structure in future WordPress versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I built the theme from scratch using only my code editor and a local WordPress install. No Node modules. No PHP libraries. No build setup whatsoever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will likely use those things before this project is complete. Some tools simply make development easier. However, not needing them or diving into more complex PHP APIs has lowered the barrier to entry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It felt like I had been transported back to the mid-2000s, just with a better system in place to take care of all the complex bits. For once, I could almost entirely focus on the design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are issues aplenty with the underlying system. Oddities like extra wrapper elements around wide-aligned blocks still exist in the editor. And, several blocks need updating &#8212; <em>I am looking at you File block for not reusing the existing Button block</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, there are quirks. As a themer, you learn to work with them in mind, wait for a fix upstream, or risk your sanity trying to find workarounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am hesitant about sharing unfinished work, but I should also show proof. Those interested can check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/x3p0-dev/x3p0-profile/tree/e65b2604c3bd695c67cb16062673519cd48c9ea1\">GitHub repo</a> at the date of this article, at least before I do anything too crazy with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some theme authors may look at my project and think it is too simple of an example. However, I could easily apply everything about it to a full-blown theme. The standards are the same, regardless of the size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe we should start rethinking what a <em>theme</em> is. With block-based theming being so young, we should all be doing a bit of experimentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"a-missed-opportunity\">A Missed Opportunity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I will get slightly technical in this bit because it is crucial for explaining a missed opportunity for a well-rounded user experience. The site editor is in a place where it is easy to build for more advanced users. Patterns help bridge the gap for those less technical, but they are not enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about the major sections of a webpage. Pieces like the header, footer, sidebar, content, and even sub-sections of those. As a user, how do you replace the entire content area design that is already on the screen with a different content pattern?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could delete the one that is there and insert a new pattern. However, deleting and inserting sections of a page is a high-risk action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the area you want to change is a template part, you can replace one with another. That is assuming the theme author has registered any for that area. This is a low-risk action and one of the best features of the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, here are header templates that Twenty Twenty-Two registers as they appear under the &#8220;Replace&#8221; toolbar menu item:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Replacing header template part in Twenty Twenty-Two.\n\n\n\n<p>However, that is not the theme&#8217;s entire array of header patterns &#8212; it has 18 in total. I imagine that most end-users will never discover them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the downsides of creating patterns meant for specific template parts is that end-users have no way of replacing or transforming a part wholesale with a new pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors can duplicate their efforts by copying the pattern code into the template part, assuming it has no PHP mixed in. Or, they can create those parts and pull in the associated pattern via the Pattern block:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;!-- wp:pattern { \"slug\":\"namespace/slug\" } --&gt;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue with this approach is that the site editor does not display the pattern content in the &#8220;Replace&#8221; dropdown (<em>did I just discover a bug?</em>):</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Template parts that use the Pattern block.\n\n\n\n<p>The solution should be simple. Patterns registered for a template part should be interchangeable via the UI. Or, parts that use the Pattern block should display correctly in the &#8220;Replace&#8221; dropdown.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 00:57:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.9 “Josephine”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12089\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/01/josephine/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55882:\"<img width=\"632\" height=\"428\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-inline-v2.png?resize=632%2C428&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12139\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"welcome-to-josephine\">Welcome to Joséphine!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Introducing 5.9, “Joséphine”.

The website got a bit of an upgrade. A partial one, at least, as developers implemented a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-mu-plugins/issues/38\">global header and footer across the site</a>. This is the first stage of a longer-term overhaul of the site&#8217;s front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Global header and footer sections on WordPress.org.\n\n\n\n<p>Not everyone was ecstatic about the change, and there were at least some mobile-related issues. Some visitors could not close an open nav menu when browsing with mobile Safari, but that issue has <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-mu-plugins/issues/110\">since been addressed</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others, such as Support Team rep Steve Stern were concerned about the rollout. &#8220;It bothers me that changes like this are made with no notification,&#8221; he said over WordPress Slack in the #meta channel. &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s on GH, but really, if you&#8217;re going to change the look/feel of support pages, it might be nice to drop a note in a place where the support team lives (or at least notify the team rep via DM or some Slack message). I can&#8217;t patrol forum messages, Slack, and things hidden in a repo about mu-plugins.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His criticism of keeping track of things is fair. Aside from the Slack app, I have 15 browser tabs open that are somewhat related to this story. WordPress has always seemed to have this problem, and you have to be in it neck-deep to keep up with the channels where everything is happening, lest you be surprised with an update like this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people noticed the growing list of links in the navigation menu. It now displays 12 top-level items. Previously, it had 10, but links for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/\">Patterns</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/openverse/\">Openverse</a> were added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We need a structure,&#8221; said Dennis Žoljom in the Slack #meta channel. &#8220;Not everything can be a top-level menu, that just doesn&#8217;t make any sense. If everything is an important piece of information, then nothing is important. Somebody should get the analytics on what page is most visited and those should be left, and the other parts should be categorized in dropdown menus or placed in the footer.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dion Hulse noted that this is merely Phase 1 of an ongoing design project. There is more to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So understandable for it to feel odd,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s one part of a lot of design work that the design teams have been up to.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a fan of the sharper and cleaner look of the new header and footer. I just have one complaint. The header is sticky, staying attached to the top of the site as readers scroll down the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know it is a personal hangup, but large sticky headers feel like walls are closing in on me as I scroll the page. It can get bad enough that I have trouble breathing. I have written about this in the past while <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/rosa-2-restaurant-theme-provides-a-frustrating-and-satisfying-experience\">reviewing a theme</a>. Do not worry about me, though. There is still a developer underneath this writer-like exterior and plenty of browser extensions for storing custom, per-site CSS. So, I am enjoying a sticky-free browsing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.org actually has two sticky sections at the top of the page. The first is the standard WordPress toolbar, and the second is the new header. Together, they combine for about 135 pixels of valuable screen real estate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the design update, at least one inconsistency across the site is blaring. Not every page displays the toolbar.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<img />Homepage with toolbar.\n\n\n\n<img />News page without toolbar.\n\n\n\n\n<p>The sticky header is more acceptable on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/\">News page</a>, but it does not display the toolbar. Snipping a few extra pixels off its top and bottom still would not hurt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of the News page, it should be receiving a new coat of paint within the next week or so. Beatriz Fialho first <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2021/06/03/redesign-of-wordpress-org-news/\">introduced the proposed redesign</a> in June 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The News page redesign has its own <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-news-2021\">GitHub repository</a>. There is also a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news-test/\">test site</a> and <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/O9I8Jl7kaUMTX39LlRGbGO/News-Page\">Figma project</a> for people who want to visually browse it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hulse said that its update &#8220;will form the base for further rollout of the style and design to other sites.&#8221; In this instance, &#8220;sites&#8221; are the subsites across WordPress.org, such as the individual Make blogs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been looking forward to the fresh style. The News section has always felt like an afterthought, especially when compared to the rest of the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am eager to see more parts of WordPress.org updated. The design was getting a bit stale. What do you think of the progress so far?</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 01:36:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:113:\"WPTavern: WordPress Community Team Updates COVID-19 Safety Guidelines to Relieve Volunteers of Enforcement Burden\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=128769\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:271:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-team-updates-covid-19-safety-guidelines-to-relieve-volunteers-of-enforcement-burden?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-community-team-updates-covid-19-safety-guidelines-to-relieve-volunteers-of-enforcement-burden\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3692:\"<p>Earlier this month the WordPress Community Team <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-team-proposes-stricter-covid-19-safety-protocols-for-in-person-events-in-2022\">proposed stricter guidelines</a> for hosting in-person events, as the pandemic continues to warrant vigilance and a nimble approach to ensuring attendees&#8217; safety. The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2022/01/24/updated-guidelines-for-in-person-wordcamps-and-meetups-2022/\">updated guidelines</a> were published today with an important change that relieves volunteers of the burden of enforcing the safety measures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new mandatory guidelines require meetup and WordCamp organizers to follow local laws for events with more than 50 attendees. If the location requires or permits venues to limit admission based on vaccination status and masking, the selected venue must be able to provide staff to enforce these measures during the event. Otherwise, the event cannot be hosted there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the area or venue cannot legally check vaccination status, organizers must ensure their location passes the <strong><a href=\"https://wordcampcentral.survey.fm/2022-host-in-person-wordpress-event-checklist\"><strong>in-person checklist</strong></a></strong> at application and at the time of the event. This checklist requires the area&#8217;s average positive case rate to average under 4% for 28 days, and to have under 50 new cases reported per 100,000 people for 14 days, among other requirements. During this Omicron surge, very few places in the world could qualify for an in-person WordPress event if using this checklist.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For the WordPress Community, another important consideration needs to be the health of the events program,&#8221; WordPress Community Team leader Angela Jin said in the announcement. &#8220;As you might imagine, the people who support this program really, truly, deeply want events that connect and inspire WordPress enthusiasts to continue! Moving forward with in-person events that risk the health of community members is unacceptable, and also poses risks to the program itself.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many participants in the comments on the original proposal asked why the team couldn&#8217;t just leave the camps to be subject to local guidelines. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It could make things easier if organizers were simply asked to follow local guidelines when planning a WordCamp,&#8221; Jin said. &#8220;In reading comments on the recent post, I am reminded that many local governments are in similar situations: at the whim of when and what the next variant will bring, and debating best approaches to safety.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another problem with following local guidelines is that these are not always safe or adequate to meet the current threat. Some people have the privilege of having their health prioritized by local officials. Others live under corrupt leaders whose political ambitions compromise the health of the people they are meant to serve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main benefits of the new guidelines is that it imposes more safety measures while protecting volunteers by offloading enforcement to the venues. This may also come at a cost in cases where WordCamps will not be able to use a venue that is not staffed on the weekends.

Pauli-Haack</em>: Hello, and welcome to our 59th episode of the Gutenberg Changelog podcast. In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg 12.4, developer hours are coming, and extensibility of Gutenberg and so much more. I&#8217;m Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and WordPress developer advocate and I&#8217;m here with my co-host, Grzegorz Ziolkowsk. JavaScript developer at Automattic and WordPress core contributor. Howdy Grzegorz, how are you today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I&#8217;m feeling very excited and that&#8217;s because I have a great pleasure to introduce our guest today, Fabian Kägy. Developer at 10up, core contributor and not unknown to the listeners and traders of the Gutenberg Times. I also see that Fabian is going to lead the next Gutenberg 12.5 release. How is it going, Fabian?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: Hey, thank you so much for having me on. I&#8217;m excited to be part of this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, Welcome Fabian. So happy to have you on the show. You have been busy around the Gutenberg project, so thank you for making the time. I heard you work for the 10up agency. That&#8217;s a large agency. How are you all adopting, working, building sites around the block editor?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: Yeah. That is correct. I&#8217;ve been working at 10up for two years now and in that time I&#8217;ve not really come across an installation of the classic editor plugin. We&#8217;ve really, full on, adapted the usage of blocks for pretty much everything that you see. We aren&#8217;t really all the way into full site editing just yet, but that is also something on the horizon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Not many people are yet, because it hasn&#8217;t been released yet. It&#8217;s coming though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. In a few days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: In a few days, yeah, Tuesday, January 25th. All right. So we have a one announcement. Yeah. Oops, sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. Be before that, I just wanted to ask, Fabian, how do you find time for contributing to Gutenberg? You are very active on that field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: For me personally, that is split, I have some overhead hours dedicated to contributing, so part of my time that I spend on open source is actually sponsored time. Currently, there&#8217;s not too much that you can do in the winter and in these weird times that we&#8217;re living in and so it&#8217;s just something that I enjoy very much and something that I&#8217;m passionate about. I want to do as much of that as I can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s wonderful. Well, thank you. You&#8217;re one of the rising stars here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And the Gutenberg project. Yeah. So we are glad you&#8217;re here. Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"announcements\"><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: And now we can go with the announcement, right? So developer hours, hurray. So Birgit, can you tell us more about the idea?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes. We will start developer hours next month. And it&#8217;s been a while that I published a proposal on the core block about this idea. I think it was back in October. So briefly the format is we will have a panel of free community developers and contributors and a short educational segment and then we open the floor for questions and discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This event is mainly for developers learning and working with blocks or the editor itself. You can bring your questions, code samples or bugs to the panel and Screen Share and we&#8217;ll try to help you out. Well, the panel will help, not so much me, but the panel will help you out. And you can also bring you ideas like, &#8220;I do this plugin for the classic editor, how would I approach it for the block editor?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are actually some great conversations that we are looking forward to. And we have a fantastic group of volunteers right now and among them, of course, Grzegorz and Fabian. Thank you. And also thank you to Tammie Lister, Nick Diego, George Mamadashvili, Daisy Olsen, and Joni Halabi, who will join in on different days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The events will be announced on the core Make Blog on the Gutenberg Times and the meet up, because they all will be located in the WordPress social learning group. So if haven&#8217;t joined that yet on meetup.com, do it now and you get automatic notification when it&#8217;s live and of course you follow Twitter. If you want to save the dates, now that you are hearing this on the podcast, it will be…. So the four events are trial events and Tuesdays, every other week. February 8th, February 22, March 8th and March 22nd. Always at 11:00 AM, Eastern 16 UTC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And after the four trial events, we will open them up to other time zones and days and we&#8217;ll all come together and kind of figure that out on the team. Yeah, that&#8217;s it. I&#8217;m really excited about this. I&#8217;m actually kicking around that idea since September, 2020 and kind of, yeah, the bandwidth for it was just not there. And, yeah, a lot of people were not in the situation where they could do additional hours spent with other people. So there was also the Zoom fatigue. Okay. Yeah. But I think we&#8217;re good now. All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. That sounds very exciting. Can you tell more about the format, in a way, where it&#8217;s going to be available would be that YouTube, I don&#8217;t know. What other platform people would be able to follow?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. We are not quite sure and we need to talk to the attendees on how they feel about recording things, because if you share code samples that might not be available for public consumption, so we need to kind of see that they are&#8230;. There will definitely be a follow up on learned lessons or what was discussed and if there were solutions which were provided, but for now, especially in the test trial, I think it would be good to maybe only record the educational segment. And when I say educational segment, what do I talk about? It&#8217;s more like, so how to add block variations or how to create dynamic blocks. Yeah. So smaller things, but that are really in the mind of a beginner developer. Also, how to add block styles, these kind of things. Or another one debugging JavaScript. So we will kind of have them in there and then that&#8217;s maybe 15 minutes and then the rest of the hour will be just open floor and who comes in and has a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do a round robin kind of, so everybody can talk about what they brought or what they are interested in and then we moderate that through the panel. Yeah. It&#8217;s going to be a meeting, not a webinar kind of thing, so we all can share screens. And so when you have something like a bug that you want to show, yeah, or a code segment that we can do this with the screens share on zoom and afterwards we have at least some blog post about it. So we know everything that was learned in this 60 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: It sounds like a local meet up, but held online. So I like the format. It&#8217;s really exciting, especially because we don&#8217;t have so many opportunities these days to meet other people in our area, which is great. So that&#8217;s great that you were able to finally set the dates and organize everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: And the group of contributors that you got together to help out is really incredible, is really strong. So I&#8217;m really looking forward to also just seeing what&#8217;s being shared in all the sessions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And for listeners, if you don&#8217;t have a problem, yeah, it might be something that you just want to hang out amongst developers and, yeah, shoot the breeze if nobody has, but we are still there. So, yeah, we can all have some discussions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"community-contribution\"><strong>Community Contribution</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of discussions, we have a community contribution and it&#8217;s a project you actually are experimenting with. Grzegorz, you want to kind of take us into that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. Actually this is the project that Fabian started. And so the idea is that, now we have the block editor handbook and other resources, which contain a lot of APIs code examples, but all of them are static. So the challenge for many developers that they cannot play with that they need to set up the whole environment like WordPress and have Gutenberg plugin, to start playing with the code, tweaking some lines of code and seeing how it impacts the data. So Fabian had this brilliant idea, let&#8217;s make Interactive. There are so many tools out there that help with that and maybe Fabian will tell more about the thing you figure out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: Sure. Definitely. Yeah. Well, actually taking a look at the new React Beta website, where they&#8217;re kind of relaunching their entire documentation. And one of the cool things that they are doing over there is showing live examples of React Code on the website, where you have an editor open and can actually explore and play with the code right on the website. And knowing that one of the common complaints that we see and hear from folks looking at Gutenberg documentation is, just getting set up initially is a hard thing. You have to make sure you have the correct node version installed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s so many things to get your local set up correctly and if you are just starting out, if you just want to learn and understand how &#8216;little efforts,&#8217; it actually is to get a block up and running or to do something there, that is a blocker that I was curious, whether it could be solved. And that is what this exploration is about. It&#8217;s using a code editor from CodeSandbox in that case, the online editors and embedding that in the page and that shows a split screen between your code editor in the browser. And then the code needs to compile in order to be previewed and that is all happening in the browsers. You have your code editor on once side, live preview on the other side and if you change something in your code, you see the live preview rendering in the browser.<em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s a little hard to describe, but I think you posted a great job in doing this on an audio podcast. And I have the pleasure to have Fabian walk me through this a little bit more yesterday, because I had no clue what that actually would do, but now I get it. So the project&#8217;s name is Gutenberg Playground, and we will have in the show notes, the site that Fabian put together as well as his code to put it together on, on GitHub. So, it&#8217;s not only good for documentation as I understood it, you could also use a similar system for tutorial. So if you are working in an agency or you are a trainer or you just want to share a little bit more interactive, what you learned about block development, you can add that also to your post once it&#8217;s a little bit more finalized. Yeah. I think Fabian, you told me yesterday, you&#8217;re still working on quite a few tweaks to make it available, to also work with a more complex coding and concepts apart from the HELLER world examples.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: Yeah. Definitely. Yeah, this actually really just started out as this exploration of, is this even possible? Can we live compile Gutenberg in a browser? And that is all it meant for initially and now the next stages, once this has now been proven it is working, well, it isn&#8217;t the fastest and there are definitely many improvements, the next steps for me personally, with this are actually taking the code that is on that example repository and trying to put that into a block, let&#8217;s say, where you could put that on your website, if you&#8217;re writing about Gutenberg stuff and if you&#8217;re teaching things with it. Yeah, just allowing you to embed that on your site and having those live examples embedded in your post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Fabulous. Yeah. If I hope it works out that way, as you envision that, so it gets to a point where many people can use it or we can actually discuss it on the documentation and code team to maybe help implement it also there. All right. Cool. Do you wanted to say something additionally, Grzegorz?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. I wanted to say that the Gutenberg project itself, the contributors are using this tool called Storybook, which is more for designing the react components, in this particular case, which allows you to browse all the components. However, the challenge with that is, that is a large collection of those components, which is very hard to navigate, for someone who doesn&#8217;t know what to look for. And it is completely separate, so you don&#8217;t have this connection, which Fabian is trying to solve here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. No. And it&#8217;s definitely a good resource for developers who just want to see how the components are working and what attributes they&#8217;re going to need or want or can, optional or default ones. I think that&#8217;s not a resource that&#8217;s also well known in the developer area, so I&#8217;m going to share that also in the show notes, the existing Storybook that is also on GitHub. I love the creativity, now that there is so much tooling going on. Yeah. The theme team also has this create this block theme out of the box on the theme dish experimentation. And I know that there&#8217;s also the block JSON Builder from David Guire just, yeah, getting better and better every week. So there&#8217;s quite some tooling now available for developers and Gutenberg and I love that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-s-released-1\"><strong>What’s Released</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So we are getting into the What&#8217;s Released section of this podcast. WordPress 5.9 is around the corner, Release Candidate 3 is out. Keep testing your plugins and themes for compatibility and post bugs you find. They are probably not going to get into the release anymore. And Tonya Mork, the release coordinator did a marvelous job rallying all the trips for each release, the Beta releases and the Release Candidates, as well as managing the change of schedule. And she invites you to observe or participate in the final release party on Tuesday, January 25th, at 1600 UTC, that&#8217;s 11:00 AM. And it will happen at the WordPress core channel, WordPress Slack. Bring your own favorite beverage, or cookies. So, and then there was Gutenberg 12.4 was released. Grzegorz, you want to lead us into that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"gutenberg-12-4\"><strong>Gutenberg 12.4</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes. So the release was led by Alex Lende and it contains several new features. It wasn&#8217;t a big release, mostly because core contributors were busy with preparing the major WordPress release. However, there are a few things to tell about, but first maybe you will tell about the new section that was added, which was a big surprise. And I really like that and big it. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I like that new section and Hector Pietro, he also did it in the core editor meeting. There is props to new contributors giving kudos to the first time contributors that joined during the last release cycle and for 12.4, it was Alberto Marin from Suffolk in England, Emir Ugljanin from Serbia and Mike Auteri from New Jersey. So welcome as contributors. And if you are interested in contributing just the shout to the regular weekly meeting for the core editor teams, Wednesdays at 1400 UTC, that&#8217;s 9:00 Eastern, in the core-editors channel, in the WordPress Slack. So now go ahead with the release. I just wanted to put this out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s great. I think the same shout out for contributors is shared for the WordPress, PHP part of core. There is this weekly update and it&#8217;s always a list of new contributors, which is really great and I&#8217;m happy that we finally have that for Gutenberg as well. And speaking of new features. So the first one that I wanted to talk about is for the post excerpt. So before, if you had, for instance, a query loop that contained at list of posts and you had post content, you had to remove this block and insert a poster excerpt instead. And now there is this challenge form option that allows the users to switch between those two at will. So that&#8217;s a really nice user experience comparing to the old behavior that we had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So, yeah, I really like that. And I think they&#8217;re also working now on transforming other content and to make them available, so you don&#8217;t have to switch out the blocks and lose content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"enhancements\"><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There were also some accessibility improvements in the Block Inserter 1 and the other one was for the list view as well. And it just kind of makes it better the Block Inserter to have a&#8230; It needed a close button. It wouldn&#8217;t display all the time for the screen reader. And then the list view part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: For the list view, it&#8217;s not only the close button, but also the escape key, when you press that it closes the list view. And the other thing that was improved, the focus, we will return to the button that is opening the list view, which is a great improvement when you don&#8217;t see the screen, because it&#8217;s much easier to orient yourself what you&#8217;d have to do next and whereas in the past the focus was lost and it was just randomly put on the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Makes sense. All right. Next, Fabian.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: Yeah. One thing that I really liked to see in this release is adding an upload states to the audio block and outside of just this item, there was also some discussion in the editor chat this week, about a similar thing of just improving the upload states and the failure states of media handling in general, with the image component, for example. If an image isn&#8217;t accepted, how all of that is treated. I think it&#8217;s great that it&#8217;s getting more robust, how Gutenberg is handling, not just the happy path, but all these different other behaviors, when your network isn&#8217;t so fast and the upload takes a little longer and so forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And there are hooks in place on the PHP side, like the WP handler upload pre-filter, where you could add error handling as well and error messages and they wouldn&#8217;t show through on the Gutenberg editor. Yeah, there is another issue in the repository that is worked on, for not only the audio, but also for image of uploads and other media uploads. Excellent. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowsk</em>i: This media, it&#8217;s also very interesting, because in practice and the browser is capable of processing the audio before it gets uploaded to the server. So you can see the media, however, this loaning indicator just ensures that people know that the processing is happening in the background. So that&#8217;s just wanted to clarify that. The same would apply to images. You see them immediately, but sending the server might take some time, depending on the connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I think for images with a new gallery block or the refactored gallery block, there is some additional handing of image uploads that are previews, so it might confuse users that they think it&#8217;s already uploaded, but it hasn&#8217;t, so they are not closing things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So what I also like it&#8217;s an update now for the Tag Cloud. It now has an outline style. So Tag Cloud is the list of tags. Previously it was in a widget, where the font size was determined by how often the Tag was used and some designers don&#8217;t like that very much, because it can&#8217;t be controlled and now with the outline stage, you can just have a list of tags, but then there are all outlined like a button. And I really like that. The views in the PR look quite nicely and it also adjusts the box, depending on what font size you use and uses all the gaps and all the nice features from display on the front end. There was some testing to be done for that. How it works with normal themes out of the box, so a theme designer doesn&#8217;t have to design anything for it, so still works. And there was some testing done, but it could probably use more. So if you&#8217;re a theme developer and look at that and see if it works for your design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. This block reminds me all the times when internet, it was all about flicker or issues and services like that, which was the killer feature of the web tag cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Tagging. Yes. But I also like it when the blogs have it in the sidebar or somewhere, because apart from the categories, you see what really the emphasis is of a blog. Because, some bloggers have all kind of different topics on their blog and you are only interested in, for instance, the WordPress ones or just the photography ones and you can quickly discover all those. It&#8217;s still important and relevant, so I like that they give some more love and care to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: The next one is change the publishing flow. It&#8217;s An addition. So we already had an option to suggest that user didn&#8217;t add taxonomy to the post and this one also brings the same priority for the category, so if they doesn&#8217;t pick any of them, then it will just say, &#8220;Maybe you should do it and consider that.&#8221; And, yeah, when you unfold the section, you just see the same category picker as you would see in the sidebar when dealing with the post or page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I really like that feature. It&#8217;s a little bit, kind of, mommy kind of thing. Yeah. Kind of reminder, but how often have we published something in the uncategorized category? Yeah. It&#8217;s kind of a little dorky. Yeah. And some people have for each site, kind of, a different method, what they do when they implement a new site. We have, for instance, change the default category. We created a news category right at the beginning of any website and then switch that over to the default category, so nobody would actually publish in an uncategorized category, but normal blogs wouldn&#8217;t do that. So this pre-published suggestion is really nice. Of course, and it&#8217;s in the second published step, so you could certainly switch that off completely if you don&#8217;t use the second step on the public&#8217;s workflow, but this certainly doesn&#8217;t have an off switch right now. So maybe we should think about every new feature we have, needs an off switch because a lot of people don&#8217;t want it. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s true. As far as I remember, you only can disable this step, but not tweak how it looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: Yeah. the next item I see on the list is, regarding the site editor and that is actually also a feature that not everybody knows about or is too familiar with, the actual keyboard shortcut help modal, which is something that you can access using the ellipsis button in the upper right corner, but this has now also gotten its own dedicated shortcut to open this very quickly, which is either control option H on macOS or control alt and H on windows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. Yes. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: It&#8217;s sort of a chicken and egg problem, because you first need to know the shortcut to open this modal to learn about the shortcut and other shortcuts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And that&#8217;s our job. Yeah. Right? We point people to things that they don&#8217;t know yet and try it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. But there&#8217;s also pretty standard shortcut. So if you try the same combination for other websites, it&#8217;s very likely that something will pop up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mm-hmm. Yeah. There was another discussion on GitHub repo, where somebody wanted to try the shift on H or something like that, shortcut to convert from the classic editor, to convert a line of normal text into a heading and was trying that out in the block editor and of course the classic editor, well, I say, of course, but it&#8217;s kind of me four years block editor experience, but if you use it for the first time, it&#8217;s not so much, yeah, self explanatory that the shortcuts from the classic editor wouldn&#8217;t work in the block editor, but there&#8217;s another way to do this. You can either do /H if you don&#8217;t have written it yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>/H gives you a heading block from the keyboard shortcut. If it&#8217;s already a line that is in a normal text paragraph format you just go to the beginning of that line, hit the pound sign twice to get an H2. So twice pound sign space and then it automatically converts the paragraph line to a heading line. So that&#8217;s a different way to get very fast to your headings. The user who had this problem had to do 50 or 60 headings a day. So he&#8217;s really using that shortcut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: All of the markdown related shortcuts in Gutenberg are really something that make me happy every single day, because I&#8217;m used to writing so much in markdown and just doing the same thing in Gutenberg. It just works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s a more technical thing. Yeah. I know that there are quite a few writers who are also developers who have been developers, they use markdown, but it&#8217;s not so much something that other bloggers are using. Yeah. And I like the technical term, the markdown markup. Yeah, kind of it&#8217;s, &#8220;What now?&#8221; Yeah. But, yeah, it&#8217;s true, yeah, if you want to do very fast lists and create lists or, yeah, heading and image inserts. It&#8217;s sometimes easier to do it via keyboard rather than wire interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"bug-fixes\"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So we are getting through the bug fixes and there were a few bug fixes. I haven&#8217;t counted them, but that looks like more than 30 or 40. And one of them is that the refactored gallery also has a migration script that converts gallery block from the first version to the second version, to the new version and it now also passes all the custom attributes that come with it, to the new gallery block. I think there were some major hiccups and that has been resolved with the 12.4 Gutenberg plugin now. And it will be, I hope in the next minor version of WordPress release that is somewhat around the corner already 5.9.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: And just to remind our listeners that gallery version 2, it means that this new approach is using inner blocks, which means that inside the gallery block, there will be image blocks that you can rearrange the way you want and change the same way the regular image block works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Thank you for pointing that out. Yes. You have all the features like duo tone, and cropping, and resizing and all that, so this is really good. And I also like that you can have different styles on the image for each picture there. So you can use the round style for, yeah, speaker heads or something like that for conferences. Yeah. One of the bug fixes also was that the query loop now uses the gap feature for the grid views, so that has been now resolved and it can now be handled like any other gaps for the columns or the media text blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: Yeah. Another item on the list that I found very interesting is, it was reverted that the paragraph block itself supports picking your own font family and I, digging into this, found the rationale behind it quite interesting, because it is so that is definitely on the horizon and something that we want to get implemented and added to the block, but right now, because there isn&#8217;t a robust solution to adding custom fonts into, kind of, that dropdown menu. It just isn&#8217;t super useful currently. And so that is why this decision was made to take out this relatively recent edition again and, yeah, revisit this in a future point when the new font registration API that was just cut out of WordPress 5.9 will eventually make its way into the Gutenberg plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. We mentioned it in our last changelog and even had it in the listener question. Okay, because it&#8217;s not a good user experience to just select between system font and nothing, so the designers are working on a better user experience. And I think it&#8217;s a good decision to wait for the web funds API, yeah, that was cut from 5.9, because it needs more testing, but I hope they release it soon, so we can have it in the Gutenberg plugin for a few user testing cycles as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then for the colors, there was one thing, there was also a big boo boo, so to speak. The coloring panel for the customizer to select colors wasn&#8217;t usable in right to left languages, because there was a double double handling. It was first handled through the CSS and then through the package and so it wouldn&#8217;t work on right to left and that is fixed now and works brilliantly now in Hebrew and Arabic and other languages that are read right to left.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. Another change that was out that is related to the templates API, but it&#8217;s more about the case when you want to define a template for your content. In post or page, you are able using PHP to define inner blocks, now they all block templates that will be embedded by default in the editor. So for instance, let&#8217;s say you want to have custom post type called books and you will just provide paragraph heading and image and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the issue was that whenever someone would provide a block that no longer is registered on the page, it wouldn&#8217;t bring very bad experience. So this one fixes that by ensuring that the proper messages displayed to the user, instead of having some broken HTML or something like that. So we will see the same message when you see whenever you uninstall and the other blocking other place, that block is missing. You will see the name of the block. I hope that in the future, if the block is inside the block directory, it will show the link, so you could install that block back. Maybe it&#8217;s implement. I haven&#8217;t checked that, but looking briefly at the PR it didn&#8217;t look like it covers that, but yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. The missing blocks that happens definitely when you deinstall a plugin that you were using before. And I think a good block manager feature that shows you which block is used, how often, would also help a user making a decision on installing a block plugin that they don&#8217;t know if it had been used on the site before. All right. Yeah. But I like that the user handling is not so much better, the messaging, but you&#8217;re still losing some content, so I need to test this a little some more if there&#8217;s some, yeah, that you can take care of, the non content loss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. And there is also good news for people who don&#8217;t remember the shortcut to the help model. There is also now, a link in the drop down menu that you see on the top right in English, when you are browsing in English and it is just the help item in the menu that allows you to open the same dialogue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"developer-experience\"><strong>Developer Experience</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Good. And then in terms of developer experience, quite a few things that we wanted to talk about here, the first two are about the JSON file Schemas for block and theme. The JSON schema now has properties to control font size, and the theme. JSON now allows for per block management of the settings and the fix has been done for the appearance tools, which you can say to false, if you don&#8217;t want users to be able to control some of the settings or styles for your site. So these are the three PR for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: Yeah. And the second item of that list, the updating the theme JSON Schema to allow per block management of the settings. That is actually something that is very useful when you&#8217;re building stuff with the theme JSON files, because by default, when you are trying to override settings on a power block basis, you&#8217;re getting all of the options that theoretically could be supported by a block, but it doesn&#8217;t list them of whether that particular block actually supports that or not. And this is something that Ryan Welcher is working on here, just to get better alignment of what the block actually supports also into the Schema.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Ryan does quite a few work behind the scenes for the JSON schemas. So, yeah, thank you. Shout for Ryan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: For the custom name. I don&#8217;t actually know too much about the feature. I can talk about the dependency stuff, but for the custom name&#8230; And since you worked on both of these,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: We have also changes to the Create Block tool. They are still not published to NPM, so you need to wait a few days until it&#8217;s available. So the first change is for supporting multiple blocks when you scaffold your plugin. And the challenge was, for now, that you couldn&#8217;t identify which part of the templates you had, are for the block and that was raised many times by developers using that tool and now is possible to do that with special configuration flag. And that also will allow us to Create Block JSON for every single block, so you will have an option to have multiple of them. And the other change that was introduced there is something that Fabian might know better, because he was one of the people arising this issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: Yeah. That is, when you previously installed and scaffolded a package using the Create Block tool, it took quite a while for you to get through this installation process. And that was mainly because previously to this fix, we were including all of the WordPress packages in the actual theme, not JSON file and so they were all being downloaded from NPM. And what&#8217;s interesting about this is that the way that the block editor works in regards to all these different packages, is that pretty much all of them are bundled in WordPress and are made available through the window object and so these packages that are installed via NPM, don&#8217;t actually get used in the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the benefits of having them is that your actual code editor can pick up some more intelligent code suggestion and if you want to do end to end testing, it is useful to have that there, but it is needed for the block to work and it made the experience of first getting started with creating your block quite slow and less ideal. And so looking at the trade offs of those two approaches, it&#8217;s the right decision to, yeah, make it so that you&#8217;re just up and running faster and you can install them if you want to, at a later point yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So is it a separate attribute?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: No. It just works on Create a Blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s built-in, so if you do Create Block, you get all the questions, but it also doesn&#8217;t download all the node modals. Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. Also based on the feedback, people who knew why those packages shouldn&#8217;t be there, they are also aware when to use them, so let&#8217;s assume for now that this default approach is better, because if someone is going to use Linter, then their Linter will complain that the package is not there, so just an example of that. If you start importing the package, it will be not installed, so you will get feedback as well. So I agree that it&#8217;s a trade off, but it&#8217;s for better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So there was also a recent change to the Create Block scaffolding, where there was a web pack feature in there, there was a fast reload that does automatic build, that wouldn&#8217;t interfere with that either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: No, not at all. Because, when you are developing a block, you don&#8217;t change all the scripts that WordPress provides, say like blocks or components or block editor packages that are converted to script handles. So it&#8217;s something that is set in stone, you don&#8217;t touch it at all, you just consume that, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. That&#8217;s a nice change. Congratulations there. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"documentation\"><strong>Documentation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next items are now in the documentation section of the release and the changelog, and then there was one for the automated theme. JSON reference documentation was added to it, the automation script that renders the documentation now has all the information from the theme JSON, including the explanations for it. So that&#8217;s definitely a good improvement there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. I&#8217;m looking at the generated page now and it&#8217;s very similar to what we covered last time for blocks. It&#8217;s just scanning all the options that team JSON has and generate something that is nicer for people to read. So it just provides all the options on one page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. That&#8217;s really good. Yeah. So we can all look it up. What does it all mean?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: The experience is getting much better with every release, because now you have support inside IDE, if you are using visuals studio code or sense tools, stuff like this PHP storm, for instance, you can install extensions that are able to work with those Schemas, but also if you just wants to go to the browser and look for things you have now also better ways to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes. And that sounds a part of the developer experience. The next thing is that now for the JavaScript APIs that are removed, it will list also which WordPress version was it removed, so people can kind of organize themselves around that. I really like that there, because, as a developer, you also have to support older versions of WordPress. So knowing which version has what and not, is definitely helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;m seeing that there are a few old APIs added to the WordPress 5.3 that are scheduled to be removed either in WordPress 6.2 or the version after that. So it&#8217;s not in the near future, but it&#8217;s just preparation, so there would be message on the JavaScript console in the browser saying that, &#8220;You are using something that won&#8217;t be supported anymore in the future. So plugin out.&#8221; Or, &#8220;Scan update their code.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Very important. Yes. So 6.2, what&#8217;s the chance that&#8217;s going to be released this year. I think it&#8217;s relatively good, but it might be next year. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. It still isn&#8217;t decided whether there will be three or four leases this year. So more likely 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So there&#8217;s another year for those. Yeah. Josepha Haden Chomphosy, she had a post on the make blog about the release schedule for 2022 and was collecting comments and she hasn&#8217;t published the outcome of that yet, but I think she&#8217;s very much in the works of it. So when we are recalling the next changelog podcasts, we probably have some more information about that. All right, what&#8217;s next? Are we through? No, we still have a few things.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"code-quality\"><strong>Code Quality</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: It still part of the code quality part. I think it&#8217;s a change that improves the readability of the code inside the block API, in particular, for block passing. It&#8217;s now in separate stages, but I don&#8217;t think it has any implication on how it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Not on the implication on how the block works, but I think it&#8217;s easier to dissect the depreciation code that you&#8230; If you change a block in the next release, you need to have a section in your block for the depreciation. And I think that tripped quite a few developers up, because it wasn&#8217;t really clear what works and what doesn&#8217;t work and it wasn&#8217;t consistently working. So they switched to dynamic blocks where the rendering is actually done in PHP and any change to the render would just be applicable to all the front end, where the block is used. I don&#8217;t think it takes care of that, but at least you&#8217;re not getting these large error messages, but that&#8217;s certainly something that trips up quite a few developers, I would think.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"tools\"><strong>Tools</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. And we are now in the tools section and there&#8217;s one interesting change. There is WordPress environment tool, in short wp-env and the change that&#8217;s there is that, in Gutenberg, there is no longer at 2021 blocks theme used, but instead there is now empty theme, which is interesting name, but the idea is that that is just the smallest amount of code you need to create a theme, and it&#8217;s used now for automated testing. And the reason for that was that every theme has opinions and can change font, colors, gradients, and the list goes on. With theme JSON is like the list is so long that you can change whatever you want. And for automatic testing, you want to have a predictable state, so this is the solution for that. But also it&#8217;s interesting because everyone can go to the Gutenberg repository, find this empty theme and see how easy it&#8217;s to create a new theme now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;m definitely going to check that out.<em>Fabian Kägy</em>: Another great enhancement in the built tooling section is for the WP scripts package, there is a new command that was added in this release that allows you to create zip of your plugin. And that is something that has always been painful, especially these days with the node modules and these source files and all those files that you don&#8217;t actually need to submit or need to upload to WordPress. And this new command now allows you to automatically just take the build files and the PHP files and kind of the assets that you need and automatically create a zip file out of that that you can use to upload your block to your own site or submit to the repository and that is kind of cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I really like that. And I think it was the first thing that I said to Greg, when I was first playing around with the Create Block scaffolding. Well, we could use a plugin ZIP right from there, because I wanted to test it out on other sites and he said, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; But sometimes it takes a while and some patience, because there are other priorities, but I really like that it&#8217;s in there. So I also have a little blog post on my personal Tag blog about that, because I was so excited when I was testing the PR of it, that it&#8217;s now available and it also has links to&#8230; Is a 10 up? That has this deploy tool from GitHub to the WordPress repository, because not everybody is fluent in SVN. So I have a link there as well. I&#8217;ve shared in the show notes, so you don&#8217;t have to go through, because it&#8217;s just a small post about that, so you can now&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: From my perspective, it becomes a bit annoying that there is no easy way to take your block and validate its content against the block directory. They have a special validator and so it allows you either to provide a zip file or GitHub repository. Creating a GitHub repository when you are just playing around is just too much, in my opinion, so this solves all the issues. Also, if you want to submit a plugin to the plugin directory, you also need to have a Zip file to start the process before the SVN magic has even created for you. So yeah. I guess, it&#8217;s going to be very useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;m really&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. And again, this is something that will be published next week probably on Thursday or maybe Wednesday evening, depends how the things go with the Gutenberg plugin release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The plugin is already released. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I mean the Gutenberg&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, the packaging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, that. So it all depends on Fabian, in fact, because he&#8217;s in charge of 12.5, so whenever he&#8217;s done with RC 1, then the packages will be published to NPM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Cool. Thank you. And this concludes our Gutenberg Changelog part of our podcast.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-s-in-active-development-or-discussed\"><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And we&#8217;re now coming to a section, which we omitted in the last few Changelog podcasts, because we had so much other things to talk about and I&#8217;m really glad that we can go back to the sections what&#8217;s in development and what&#8217;s discussed, and I&#8217;m glad we have Fabian on the show today and there was a reason for it, not only for the Gutenberg playground. So you posted a proposal on the GitHub discussions for opening the editor interface to more extensibility. It&#8217;s a long post, but could you summarize it for our listeners, Fabian?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: Yeah. Of course, I&#8217;d love to. It is a proposal going over, especially in custom builds in the world that I&#8217;m coming from in these custom client builds, there often are problems that we need to solve for that aren&#8217;t really right for everybody. That isn&#8217;t something that the Gutenberg plugin should do by default, because it may be too confusing or too specialized of a use case. And in a lot of those cases, it just comes down to needing to be able to have slots available in Gutenberg or have APIs to extend and change the core behavior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that has been something that purposefully has been kept very closed for a long time, and there are very good reasons for it because it can very badly hurt performance, it can make it very difficult to maintain the project long term and so I&#8217;ve created this discussion to start a thread of just, yeah, a place where we can collect issues that we&#8217;re running into, collect thoughts of, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;d like to be able to do this kind of extension.&#8221; So that we can hopefully may maybe come up with solutions of how we can not hurt performance and these goals of the project, but still allows some more customization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. I think that there is an answer from Riad on the discussion on GitHub that pretty much summarizes the reasons why core team was so conservative about limiting the number of new extension points. In short, my version of that is, because full site editing project or in full motion and if you look back and see how the interface changed, if you would open too many places for extensions, we would have to keep similar interface to ensure that all of the plugins that modify that still work. It&#8217;s a bit sad that we didn&#8217;t do that here, but now we also are in a good position to collect all the use cases that plugin outers have, and together think about the best approaches for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so in the past, it was much easier to extend everything, because it was based on PHP and the flow was easy, because you just run some PHP modify think and you output some HTML code. Whereas in the block editor, everything is interactive. So it&#8217;s not that simple to apply the changes, because it needs to be done in the right time and reapply it after something else changes. So it needs much more thinking. Well, I think we will do that eventually, but we are looking for feedback on this GitHub discussions from all the plugin authors, because this will help us to drive the development. So thank you Fabian for starting something more broad, because we had a lot of issues created in the past, but they were oriented for this particular cases, user head, and now it&#8217;s time to collect them together in one place and think, &#8220;Okay, what next?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, thank you. And this is the call for you, dear listeners, if you have a certain use case that you would like to tackle with the block editor, but you didn&#8217;t see or find the right place yet to tab into it, like a hooks or a filter, yeah, now would be a good time to, if you haven&#8217;t yet, create an issue and add it to that discussion so the developers can kind of really collect all their use cases and think about, &#8220;Okay, what would be the right approach.&#8221; But I can see how it takes a while to be ready for that when you have a moving target. Yeah. And if you don&#8217;t know yet how this all works, that there&#8217;s a lot of development that went back to figure out, &#8220;Okay, now this is a block that works in the post, but it doesn&#8217;t work in the rigid editor or site editor. And now you have to change it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that block would have a filter or a hook to be changed, yeah, all of the backwards compatibility would kind of stifle this new development already, in a very early stage. So I really see how that was a hold close to the vest, but yeah, starting a discussion is a really good way to start also the process to getting this opened up a bit more for the extenders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Thank you very much for putting this out there. In terms of the extension, there are two things in the works and I got them from the core editor meeting. Nick Seguras has an update that query loop block now supports custom taxonomies. That was certainly something that, yeah, when you have custom post types, you also want the custom taxonomies being available to the block editor and that is now available in the Gutenberg plug in, so it can be used furthermore. He also added support for multiple author filtering, in the query block. That was also a request from a few site owners that have multiple editors that coming through, actually, be able to have separate editor pages, for instance, where this is helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: Yeah. And especially for the query loop block and all of the new things like now, custom taxonomy support, looking at the pull request, this is the first step. This was now merged in and the query loop block now supports those custom taxonomies, but the UI is still something that definitely is looking for some refinement. And there have been some great actual discoveries into this. I think Sean Andres did some great experimentation with how the pattern that we see in the dimension panel, and also the font panel in Gutenberg, where you can toggle on or off different features, like how something like that could be included in the query block. And I think there are definitely some movements going on, on that query loop block that may be in interesting to see how far we get by the time 6.0 gets released.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And that&#8217;s exactly what Nick also said that he really thinks it needs particular testing and for any regression and also, yeah, kind of buck fixes or bug reports would be really helpful to get it to the next stage. This is just the first version. As always in WordPress, first versions are minimal viable product. Yeah. It works somehow, but there it&#8217;s not yet the final stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: There is also another work in progress that was rise by Jorge Costa. It&#8217;s actually proof of concept that was developed by Riad Benguela. And the idea is that, right now, when you have a team, you have global styles. However, the intent is that it would be great if you could just switch only the styles part and leave the rest of the theme the same. So what&#8217;s being explored is a special picker or switcher that shows different variations of the same theme that changes fonts, colors, and stuff like this. Let&#8217;s say in the far future, you just have your own taste for colors, fonts, and so on, and you just install that in your theme and you can check whether that works together. So I think that&#8217;s a really promising and exploration is happening and, yeah, we are looking for feedback and see how people like it. And it&#8217;s also quite similar to the demo that was presented during the State of the Word where Matt was playing a video that showed this idea that the same thing, how different it looks if you just switch colors, fonts and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. and I think that&#8217;s the part that was still missing from FSC and now it&#8217;s merged with Gutenberg trunk, so if you use the Gutenberg nightly, that comes out of the Gutenberg Times, you should already be able to test it with a normal plugin, zip and, yeah, send in your feedback for that. All right. Is there anything else that you want to talk about? Any reminders or announcements or something you didn&#8217;t get a chance to talk about, Fabian?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: I don&#8217;t think so. I think we&#8217;ve covered pretty much all the items that I had on my list. I think it&#8217;s, again, a great call out for anybody who has opinions and thoughts or examples of what they weren&#8217;t previously able to do, because there wasn&#8217;t a slot for something, just to add those items to the discussion, because it is super useful and we can only get this right if we have actual examples of what folks are trying to do. So I&#8217;d encourage everybody to add their thoughts there, but outside of that, I think I have everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. So if people want to reach you, how can they get in touch with you, Fabian?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: You can find me always active in the WordPress Slack, and of course on Twitter @FabianKägy. Maybe you put that in the podcast notes also because it&#8217;s not the easiest to spell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. That&#8217;s true. It has this German Umlaut thingy in there and the two dots there. All right. So before we end the show, also reminder from me, developer hours are coming, keep an eye out for the announcements and join us with all your developer questions on building blocks or working with the Gutenberg block editor. All right. As always the show notes will be published on gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. This is episode 59. I&#8217;ve just realized that it&#8217;s WordPress 5.9 and Gutenberg Changelog 59, so, yeah, that&#8217;s a coincidence, but I like it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. So show notes are publish guttenbergtimes.com\\podcast episode 59. If you have questions and suggestions or news, you want us to include the next time, send them to <a href=\"mailto:changelog@guttenbergtimes.com\">changelog@guttenbergtimes.com</a>. Yeah. That&#8217;s an email address for <a href=\"mailto:changelog@guttenbergtimes.com\">changelog@guttenbergtimes.com</a> or you can just kind of reach out to Grzegorz or myself via Twitter on the ends or, of course, on the WordPress Slack. We are all active there. So thank you so much for joining us again, Fabian. And also thank you Grzegorz for a wonderful show. I think we got a little bit more out of that. Oh, next item. So we talk a little bit more about what&#8217;s happening in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, that was great. Thank you both for a great chat. And thank you to our listeners for being with us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And if you like the show, send us a review. Bye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Bye.

The summit is the first of its kind in the WordPress space &#8211; an event entirely focused on job seekers and employers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attendees will have the opportunity to network with each other, check out job postings, visit live virtual sponsor tables, and connect with companies that are actively hiring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Back in 2020 I saw companies posting jobs and I saw friends posting a need for jobs, and I thought we needed to find a way to match those people with companies,&#8221; WP Career Summit organizer Michelle Frechette said. &#8220;So I built <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://wpcareerpages.com/\" target=\"_blank\">wpcareerpages.com</a> and started tweeting a job thread every Wednesday.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After awhile of regularly tweeting the Wednesday job thread, Frechette found that it started to take off. Depending on the week, her threads would get anywhere from 2k-18k impressions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Clearly, there is a need,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I’ve had people tell me they’ve found their new job through those tweets. As a result of that project and conversations with Allie Nimmons around underrepresentation, <a href=\"http://underrepresentedintech.com/\">underrepresentedintech.com</a> was born, and projects and people started getting paired up through that site.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frechette said when she first joined the team at Post Status, she was tasked with writing about underrepresentation and job-related content, topics for which she has a passion. She pitched the idea of a career conference to Cory Miller, the club&#8217;s new owner, and he loved it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My hope is that this summit is the start of even bigger conversations in the WordPress community about connecting talent with opportunity, especially for those graduating from training and education and starting their careers,&#8221; Frechette said. &#8220;If we can get younger talent into WordPress, in my opinion, we should see even more growth in our ecosystem.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The call for speakers and sponsors is now open. Jonathan Wold is managing the sponsorship aspect of the event and Post Status has hired Dan Maby from Big Orange Heart to run the tech part of the conference using the platform he developed and uses for WordFest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers are looking for speakers who are particularly adept at job hunting or who are knowledgeable about how to recruit and hire talent. Selected speakers will share their expertise in 30-minute recorded presentations and will receive a $200 stipend for participating. WP Career Summit will be a virtual event but will have 15 minutes of live Q&amp;A time immediately following each session.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wpcareersummit.com/register-to-attend/\">Registration</a> is now open and is free, thanks to the event&#8217;s sponsors. Attendees will be emailed information about how to log in and participate closer to the event. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 22 Jan 2022 02:50:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: BlackPress Meetup To Host Meet and Greet Mixer on January 27\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=128621\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:185:\"https://wptavern.com/blackpress-meetup-to-host-meet-and-greet-mixer-on-january-27?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=blackpress-meetup-to-host-meet-and-greet-mixer-on-january-27\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4794:\"<img />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Established this year by Destiny Fox Kanno and Joe A. Simpson, Jr, the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/blackpress-meetup/\">BlackPress Meetup</a> group will host its <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/blackpress-meetup/events/283221243/\">first event next week</a>. It will be a meet-and-greet social hour for attendees. The session will run from 7pm to 8pm CST on Thursday, January 27.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a <a href=\"http://blackpress-group.slack.com/\">BlackPress Slack</a> group they want to raise awareness about and bring more people in. It can be handy for members to asynchronously communicate about the event, discuss broader topics, and talk with others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our goal is to both bring more creators of Black African descent into the WordPress Community and also provide a Community space for those already there to connect, learn from, and support each other,&#8221; responded the organizers on the reason for the Meetup. &#8220;This Meetup was also created to raise awareness about WordPress, recruit organizers and volunteers, and eventually lead to a WordCamp-style event on an HBCU campus.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/piyopiyofox/\">Kanno</a> is an Automattic-sponsored Developer Relations Advocate from the San Francisco Bay area. She helps global WordPress contributors get the most out of available tools and resources to create products and sites for and with globally-diverse online communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/joesimpsonjr/\">Simpson</a> is a Digital Communications Administrator at Metro Los Angeles and a team rep for the WordPress Accessibility Team. He is also a Community Deputy, leading three WordCamps and two WordPress-related Meetups in Santa Clarita, California.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The format of the event is an open video chat. There will be a central room where anyone can chime in at any time. However, there will also be some time in breakout rooms if there is a large enough turnout. This would allow more intimate discussions and attendees to speak directly with others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the co-organizers are not yet shooting for weekly meetings. &#8220;We would love to have a regular schedule like that, but since this group has just started, we are targeting monthly Meetups for now while we build our network and momentum,&#8221; they responded. &#8220;Once we have regular membership, we will most definitely try to accommodate not only more regular meetings but more meetings in other time zones as well.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This also plays into how they will run future events and their content. The goal for the first Meetup is to identify the community&#8217;s needs. Some example questions they posed were:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Do we have a large number of folks who are creating themes and plugins or are working on design, accessibility, or marketing, etc.?</li><li>Are folks mostly freelancers or working for larger businesses?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Once we get a better understanding of this, we would like to create more targeted events and spaces for folks to knowledge share and collaborate with their peers,&#8221; they said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are also looking for speakers to present at future events.  Anyone interested should let the co-organizers know if they can contribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We definitely have ambitions to have our next Meetup event include a speaker for a certain topic &#8212; potentially a look ahead for the 6.0 WordPress release,&#8221; they said. &#8220;We are also hopeful to have a Mega Meetup event as this is a globally-focused group and an end-of-year release holiday party event.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-61f1ff856b2a6 wp-block-group has-neutral-100-background-color has-background\">\n<h2 id=\"meet-and-greet-mixer\">Meet and Greet Mixer</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-top ticss-b48fe0ba\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top\">\n<p class=\"has-base-font-size\">Thursday, January 27, 2022<br />7pm &#8211; 8pm CST</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-61f1ff856b029 wp-block-buttons\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https://www.meetup.com/blackpress-meetup/events/283221243/\">View Event →</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> Please join us for BlackPress&#8217;s first meetup event focused on networking with fellow community members.

Having both watched the discussion and shared my informal thoughts on Twitter as well as the Post Status Slack group, I was invited to write a lengthier article about the subject.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To begin, here’s a summary of my current thoughts:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As WordPress matures, I believe more open discussion needs to be had about:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How the various WordPress and Automattic entities are inextricably linked</li><li>Potential conflicts of interest</li><li>Who officially speaks for the WordPress open source project internally and externally</li><li>Transparency and formalization around governance</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-wordpress-where-we-are-now-and-why-it-s-worth-writing-about\">WordPress: Where we are now and why it’s worth writing about</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I agreed to write this article as I’ve long been interested in this topic. It was the excuse I needed to dive headfirst into the multitude of posts, research, and books that I knew existed but didn’t previously have time for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As it turns out, this article was very difficult to write because the more I learned, the more my views and writing evolved.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>I’m writing this to bring awareness and not blind criticism to these issues. I want to ignite curiosity and conversation around them as I believe they are worth discussing.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Where I’ve landed is a place of empathy, respect, and curiosity. To get to where we are, WordPress’ leaders had to get so much right. It’s impressive, and I’m so glad to be a part of this community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, there’s so much more to be done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What follows are my thoughts and explorations on this subject. I’m writing them not because I believe I’m smart and/or right, but because:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I believe more transparency and research are needed around the subjects of governance and WordPress as a commons.</li><li>I believe this is something that should be actively discussed so that good ideas might emerge from bad ones; and that, with every new person and perspective that joins, previously hidden research and successful case studies might be unearthed so we might learn from them.</li><li>I believe this is a very complex issue that benefits from more eyes, brains, voices, and, most importantly, <strong><em>sunlight</em></strong>. Without bringing the history and consequences of past choices to light, we risk wrongly calling for reform and failing the <a href=\"https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/\">Chesterton’s Fence</a> heuristic.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, I’m writing this to bring awareness and not blind criticism to these issues. I want to ignite curiosity and conversation around them as I believe they are worth discussing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-convoluted-current-state-of-affairs\">The convoluted current state of affairs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a lack of clarity and distinction around the roles and responsibilities of Automattic, WordPress.com, WordPress.org, and the WordPress Foundation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, it’s not clear who external and internal parties should turn to for guidance, governance, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an example, here’s some of the confusing overlap between leadership roles at WordPress:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg is the CEO of Automattic, the organization that runs WordPress.com: a hosting company. He is also the <a href=\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/projects/\">Director of the WordPress Foundation</a>, a charitable organization he founded.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha Haden Chomphosy is an employee of Automattic and the lead for their open source division. She is also the <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">Executive Director of the WordPress Project</a>. As far as I can tell, Josepha has no direct ties to the WordPress Foundation despite the significant overlap in its mission and her job scope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If all this sounds quite confusing, it’s because it is. Personally, I didn’t even know the WordPress Foundation existed until I did the research for this article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, Matt and Josepha, themselves, have difficulty delineating where Automattic begins and WordPress.org starts. Here’s an excerpt from <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/05/the-commons-of-images/\">Episode 8: The Commons of Images</a> at the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/podcast/\">WP Briefing</a>, a podcast hosted by Josepha. This episode features Matt talking about Automattic’s acquisition of CC Search, now renamed <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/openverse/\">Openverse</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 15:47</strong></p><p>I’ve been asked a few times, and I think you have been asked a few times whether this is an actual acquisition. And If yes, then what entity is it under? Is it under the WordPress Foundation? Is it under Automattic?</p><p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; 16:10</strong></p><p>It’s a little complicated because, as you know, WordPress.org is not part of the Foundation. So basically, Automattic paid Creative Commons, the nonprofit. They will essentially redirect the old URL, so old links to Creative Commons Search won’t break. And we ended up hiring some of the people that they were parting ways with into Automattic. And then we put that open source code, and we’ll run the service on WordPress.org, and then those we hired, Automattic hired, will contribute to WordPress.org and the open source projects that power what we’re calling Openverse now.</p><p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 16:54</strong></p><p>I am.</p><p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; 16:56</strong></p><p>That’s kind of an acquisition, but also from a nonprofit, and then going into something, which is not a nonprofit, but is open source and sort of freely available, which is WordPress.org, the website.</p><p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 17:06</strong></p><p>Yeah, that has been hard for me to answer because you’re right, it’s not like it was donated to WordPress or something. But everything that we’re doing is being donated back to the project, and of course, hopefully, really living into that WordPress ethos that we have of giving back to, to the project, something that made your work and your life better. So there’s some, some finger-crossing going on in there.</p><cite><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/05/the-commons-of-images/\">Episode 8: The Commons of Images</a> at the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/podcast/\">WP Briefing</a>.</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, the blurred lines can lead to some <em>very interesting</em> organizational relationships. Many of which are difficult, if not impossible, to untangle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be fair, this isn\'t just criticism. I believe the blurred lines are a large reason why the WordPress open source project has been so successful. It’s much easier to advance an open source project from the CEO seat of a multi-billion dollar corporation than it is as the Director of a charitable organization with <a href=\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/2020-financials/\">donations amounting to $10k in 2020</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This benefit is huge and why it’s hard to confidently say the current state of affairs is untenable. This is also why I\'m calling for discussion rather than a call to action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, let\'s look at the internal and external implications of this entanglement.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-looking-outward-the-wider-ecosystem\">Looking Outward: The Wider Ecosystem&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It’s built on the backs of other open source projects, like PHP. Additionally, there are many other open source CMSes that exist, like Drupal. Finally, millions of sites are built on WordPress, like <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/\">whitehouse.gov</a>. This is the ecosystem within which WordPress exists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open source projects like <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/phpfoundation\">PHP</a> and <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/association\">Drupal</a> have foundations and associations that are the faces of the software projects and their communities. When <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828303/log4j-library-vulnerability-log4shell-zero-day-exploit\">things go wrong</a>, stakeholders need to have somewhere to find guidance and seek help. Through these organizations, each project has the leadership to guide and defend it. In contrast, WordPress’ foundation seems more like a side project than a governing body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress professionals often throw around the 40% market share figure WordPress commands. A number that spiked in the pandemic and has only continued to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as adoption increases, so do the risks. Having a small hamstrung foundation is an interesting experiment if WordPress was simply a quaint, albeit popular, way to blog. It becomes an issue when the American government calls the next Open Source Summit and 40% of the web is not adequately represented.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-questions-worth-asking-about-wordpress-and-its-wider-ecosystem\">Questions worth asking about WordPress and its wider ecosystem</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned at the beginning, the point of this post isn’t to provide answers. It’s to ignite curiosity and conversation. Here are some questions worth asking:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Questions about WordPress and the wider ecosystem</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Who officially speaks for WordPress, the open source project?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Questions about The WordPress Foundation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Is there a constitution, mandate or goals? Who wrote and approved them?</li><li>Who does the Foundation represent?</li><li>Who are its members? And how does one become a member?</li><li>Who are its leaders? And how does one become a leader?</li><li>What are the responsibilities of the various roles?</li><li>How are decisions made and issues tabled?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Questions about potential conflicts of interest</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Where does Automattic end and the Foundation start?</li><li>As an employee of Automattic, is Josepha Haden Champosy’s responsibility first and foremost to the company or the WordPress open source project?</li><li>Are there examples of past conflicts of interest? How were they resolved?</li><li>What are some advantages of the current way of doing things? What would we be foregoing if the Foundation had more power? Are the trade-offs worth it?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-looking-inward-the-wordpress-community\">Looking Inward: The WordPress Community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Internally, there are two key issues that surface time and again in varying forms within the WordPress community. They are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Insufficient repercussions for bad actors.</strong> Lots of people abuse the system and sanctions are applied haphazardly or not at all.</li><li><strong>Onboarding more contributors.</strong> It’s hard to get the number of contributors we need and onboard them at scale.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>At the face of it, these issues don’t seem related to governance or the lack of clarity and formalization around leadership and systems. But once you dig deeper, you’ll see how they’re linked. For example, the lack of formalization around WordPress’ governance makes enforceability difficult as enforcers don’t have much of a mandate. It also makes it hard to lobby for more resources when you don’t know to whom you should lobby or how.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s explore these concerns with more specificity below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-1-insufficient-repercussions-for-bad-actors\">1. Insufficient repercussions for bad actors</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bad actors are inevitable in a project as large and diverse as WordPress. Eliminating them would be as impossible as eliminating crime in a country. This isn’t a discussion about that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, what matters is the lack of disincentives for bad actors. Rules are notoriously implemented on an ad hoc basis, and people who have been banned can simply reappear with new email addresses. Furthermore, there are no repercussions for poor or inconsistent enforcement. Nor are there formal processes to report poor enforcement or review how the rules are being applied. If no one is watching the watchers, how do we know if they’re doing a good job?</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-questions-worth-asking-about-rules-enforcement-and-oversight\">Questions worth asking about rules, enforcement, and oversight</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Who enforces the rules?</li><li>How are they chosen?</li><li>Who ensures the enforcers are doing a good job? And what can be done if they’re not?</li><li>Who writes the rules?</li><li>Who decides if the rules should be changed?</li><li>What is the process for deciding if the rules should be changed?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-2-onboarding-more-contributors\">2. Onboarding more contributors</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As WordPress grows, the number of contributors needs to grow too. To understand the mindset of a potential contributor, we can use a simple equation proposed by <a href=\"https://corte.si/posts/opensource/ostrom/\">Aldo Cortesi</a> that’s inspired by Elinor Ostrom’s original equation governing physical commons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>BC &gt; BN + C</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>BC</strong> is the benefit of contributing, which has to outweigh the cost of contributing (<strong>C</strong>) plus the benefit of not contributing (<strong>BN</strong>).</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-let-s-first-explore-bc-the-benefits-of-contributing\">Let’s first explore BC: the benefits of contributing</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>BC (benefit of contributing) can also be called Incentives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, most major contribution efforts are from full-time employees of some of the biggest companies in the ecosystem. Their remuneration is their main incentive for doing the work. This is pretty clear-cut.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Let’s make it even simpler: <em>You want to introduce FOMO for non-contributors</em>.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The long tail of work is contributed out of personal interest and wanting to give back to the community aka a “helping the commons” mentality.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-a-basket-of-incentives\">A basket of incentives</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>People are often quick to equate incentives with money, but money is just one of many incentives, and I believe it’s the least compelling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While money is a critical and necessary part of any incentive structure, it’s never just about the money for most people. If it were, people would optimize solely to make it. They wouldn’t be contributing to an open source project, they’d be trading NFTs, mining minerals, financing M&A; or whatever it is that brings in the most money these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prominent open source maintainer Jeff Geerling explains in a helpful <a href=\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2022/burden-open-source-maintainer\">blog post on the burdens of an open source maintainer</a>, “The truth is, money won\'t prevent the next Log4J vulnerability or prevent maintainer burnout (leading to the next <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dev-corrupts-npm-libs-colors-and-faker-breaking-thousands-of-apps/\">colors and faker fiasco</a>). It helps, and it\'s necessary to try to fund developers better—but you can\'t just say &#8220;Microsoft should pay developer X $80,000/year and that will prevent another <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Shellshock_(software_bug)\">Shellshock</a>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In practice, money can only solve money problems, like rent, medical bills, and debt. But beyond that, additional incentives are needed to ensure meaningful contributions are made to maintain a healthy commons.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-bn-benefits-of-not-contributing\">BN: Benefits of not contributing</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal is to have as low a BN as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The weird “benefit that you want to reduce” phrasing is tricky to understand. Here’s how you can look at it:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All improvements made to the WordPress commons are shared by all. When this happens, people benefit even when they don’t contribute. In order to reduce the benefit of not contributing, you want to create some benefits that are only accessible to people who <em>do</em> contribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s make it even simpler: <em>You want to introduce FOMO for non-contributors</em>. (Fear of Missing Out)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Got it? Great.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-cost-lowering-cost-barriers-to-contribution\">Cost: Lowering cost/barriers to contribution</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>One need only turn to Twitter to feel the frustrations of the high costs of contributing. As WordPress developer, Dan Cameron, shared in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dancameron/status/1482121893427568642\">his tweet</a>, “the major problem, from my experience, is that a valid contribution can be ignored — for years. The only way to &#8220;contribute&#8221; is to be directed by a release lead, and most of those experiences can be very exhausting/frustrating.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I imagine many others have similar experiences. It has been my experience too. In the past couple of years, I’ve made tiny contributions in the form of FSE testing, reporting a bug, and most recently, proofreading posts for Learn WP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In all three cases, I needed at least 10-20 mins of help each from Anne McCarthy, Tonya Mork, Israel Barragan, and Courtney Robertson. They helpfully explained the steps I needed to take to contribute. They helped me get set up, gave me context, and set expectations so I was able to contribute correctly and in the WordPress way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I need to make it clear that the 3 tasks I did were <em>very</em> simple things. The amount of time it took for them to help me was far more than the time I took to contribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now imagine scaling this up and you can quickly see the bottleneck.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-questions-worth-asking-about-onboarding-more-contributors\">Questions worth asking about onboarding more contributors</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>General questions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Who are the people responsible for improving the contributor experience? How were they chosen? What are their roles and mandates? How are they paid/incentivized?</li><li>What’s currently being done to make it easier to onboard contributors?</li><li>What would a world look like if contributions were normalized?</li><li>What is the “between the cracks” work of contributions that needs to be done?</li><li>What are the minimum requirements of a contributor and where can I find them?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Questions about benefits of contributing (BC)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How can we increase the benefits of contributing, in ways that aren’t solely financial?</li><li>How can we celebrate contributors?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Questions about benefits of </strong><strong><em>not</em></strong><strong> contributing (BN)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How can we increase FOMO for non-contributors?</li><li>How can we make it less intimidating to contribute?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Questions about costs of contributing</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What are the current costs of contributing?</li><li>Should we decrease the cost of contributing? In what way are the current costs necessary?</li><li>How can we decrease the cost of contributing?</li><li>If I don’t want to speak with anybody in the process, are there still ways for me to contribute?</li><li>What informal, social cues exist for contributors that ought to be formalized and documented? Which should persist?</li><li>In what ways is contributing frustrating? Intimidating? How can we reduce this?</li><li>How can we encourage contributions from people for whom English is not their first language, beyond just polyglot work?</li><li>How can we give money to contributors to reduce the opportunity cost of contributing?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-wordpress-as-a-commons\">WordPress as a commons</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you made it this far, you might have noticed I mentioned ‘WordPress as a commons’ multiple times. Indeed, that’s the title of this post!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So before I wrap up, let’s explore this concept a little bit more and see why it matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-is-the-tragedy-of-the-commons\">What is the tragedy of the commons?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The term tragedy of the commons was conceived of by Garrett Hardin in 1968.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand what it means, let’s refer to an explanation by the <a href=\"https://iasc-commons.org/about-commons/\">International Association for the Study of the Commons</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people share a resource they will over-harvest it because it is in their individual interest to take as much from the resource as possible; depletion of the commons could, according to Hardin, only be prevented via private property rights and governmental regulation. The term ‘tragedy’ referred to the argument that people are not able to self-govern common resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg loves talking about WordPress as a commons. In fact, he recently spoke at length about it in the<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/12/highlights-from-state-of-the-word-2021/\"> State of the Word 2021</a>. Here’s an excerpt:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>In the digital world, at least, I think it’s possible to have an abundance of the commons. So the more people that use a program the better. It gets [better] in so many ways — more bugs get reported, more translations happening,… more plugins get developed, more themes get developed. And so the more people that use WordPress, WordPress doesn’t get any worse for any of you. In fact, the more people that use it, the better it gets.</p><p>But part of that is some percentage of the people who essentially directly benefit from WordPress, putting something back into the comments, fertilizing the soil, planting some more grass&#8230;</p><cite>Excerpt taken from<a href=\"https://thewpminute.com/state-of-the-word-2021/\"> The WP Minute’s transcription</a> of the talk.</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-avoiding-the-tragedy-of-the-commons\">Avoiding the tragedy of the commons</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since learning about the tragedy of the commons in university, I always believed the tragedy was inevitable and every commons was bound to either fail or become privatized. And all one could do was put off the inevitable for as long as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine my delight when I found out researchers across multiple fields have found many real-world examples of self-sustaining commons that neither ended in tragedy nor needed the installation of private property rights or government regulation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most notable of these researchers is Nobel Laureate, Elinor Ostrom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most famously, she derived 8 principles necessary for successful self-governance. They are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The common pool resource has clearly-defined boundaries (effective exclusion of external unentitled parties)</li><li>There is congruence between the resource environment and its governance structure or rules</li><li>Decisions are made through collective-choice arrangements that allow most resource appropriators to participate</li><li>Rules are enforced through effective monitoring by monitors who are part of or accountable to the appropriators</li><li>Violations are punished with graduated sanctions</li><li>Conflicts and issues are addressed with low-cost and easy-to-access conflict resolution mechanisms</li><li>Higher-level authorities recognize the right of the resource appropriators to self-govern</li><li>In the case of larger common-pool resources: rules are organized and enforced through multiple layers of nested enterprises</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-the-tragedy-of-not-talking-about-elinor-ostrom\">The tragedy of not talking about Elinor Ostrom</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Given how often Matt talks about it, I’ve always found it curious that he never mentions Ostrom or that this problem has already been demonstrably solved many times or that principles exist to solve it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I thought to bring it up because so many of her principles map to the issues raised in this article.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-questions-worth-asking-about-successful-self-governance\">Questions worth asking about successful self-governance</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Do all of Ostrom’s 8 principles apply to WordPress?</li><li>How can Ostrom’s 8 principles be applied to WordPress?</li><li>In what ways are Ostrom’s 8 principles already successfully applied in WordPress?</li><li>Are there any articles of successfully self-governed open source projects written about how their governance maps to Ostrom’s principles?</li><li>What are Matt and Josepha’s views on Ostrom?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-further-discussion\">Further discussion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said at the beginning, I don’t profess to have any answers. The purpose of this post was to further discussion around a variety of topics because I believe they are important ones for the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, I’ve asked a lot of questions in this post. So it’s only fitting that I end it with even more!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a bunch of bird’s eye view questions to further the discussion:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The WordPress open source project is inextricably linked to Automattic.

This “volunteer’s dilemma” is similar to the well-known concept of the <a href=\"https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/TragedyoftheCommons.html\">tragedy of the commons</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Following a Community-wide Call for Proposals that generates many well-defined, actionable research ideas, we could pursue the resources needed to make the research studies a reality.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The more <a href=\"https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/12/finding-critical-open-source-projects.html\">critical the project</a>, the more we should all be concerned about its future. Today, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/news/log4j-google-and-ibm-call-for-list-of-critical-open-source-projects/\">WordPress and a number of well-known WordPress plugins are indeed critical</a> projects in a global context where big Tech companies and national governments are taking a deeper interest in their security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to initiatives like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\">Five for the Future</a>, WordPress (core) has a significant number of paid contributors so it is in a better situation than many other projects, but this doesn’t mean we are safe or that we could not advance faster if we were able to attract (and retain!) more contributors in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many strategies we could borrow from other communities, but each community is different we cannot just copy and paste their solutions. No single solution has had spectacular success on its own anyway; in fact, OSS sustainability is an important <a href=\"https://livablesoftware.com/learned-software-development-mining-github-plus-concerns/\">ongoing research area</a> because there are no definitive solutions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to first agree on what (sub)challenges we consider the most relevant one/s, what resources are available to address those challenges, and how we want to allocate these resources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-call-for-proposals-what-are-the-most-important-questions-to-ask\">Call for Proposals: What Are the Most Important Questions to Ask?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s look at some (overlapping) topics I’d like to see discussed/analyzed in the coming year and beyond. The questions below target different dimensions of the WordPress community, and many of them are inspired by some of the research I’ve seen or done in software analytics conferences and journals like <a href=\"https://oss2022.github.io/\">OSS</a>, <a href=\"https://conf.researchr.org/home/msr-2022\">MSR</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.springer.com/journal/10664\">EMSE</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Scope</strong>: <strong>What should we be most concerned about?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><ul><li>Only with WordPress itself?</li><li>The WordPress ecosystem of plugins, themes, blocks, etc.?</li><li>The libraries that WordPress uses internally?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Onboarding New Members: How can we attract more contributors?</strong><ul><li>Would moving development to GitHub lower the barrier to entry? (Especially for occasional contributors who will not install Subversion just to make a small contribution.)</li><li>Are we able to attract JavaScript people? (We are probably better at attracting PHP people.)</li><li>How can we best attract non-coding contributors? (Who are <a href=\"https://livablesoftware.com/importance-of-non-tech-contributor-roles-open-source/\">clearly important</a> in any OSS project.)</li><li>What is the best strategy to help people who would be interested in contributing? (E.g., mentoring, “first-bug” labels, bug bounties, reaching out to specific communities where we think there could be interested people.)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Contributors: How can we keep new members and help them grow?</strong><ul><li>How to turn new members into regular contributors?&nbsp;</li><li>Why do some leave?</li><li>What benefits can we give regular contributors (e.g. visibility) for contributing?</li><li>How do we reward contributors? (For sure, not based on the number of commits. We should investigate more complex models using tools like<a href=\"https://sourcecred.io/\"> SourceCred</a>.)</li><li>How do we redirect contributors to the areas that require more work? (I can tell you <a href=\"https://livablesoftware.com/online-division-labour-self-organization-open-source/\">this will not happen naturally</a>, so we need to gently push people to work where we need them.)</li><li>Could bots be a useful tool to help contributors focus on the important and creative tasks?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Community Analysis</strong><ul><li><strong>Volunteers and Paid Contributors:</strong> We need clear numbers informing the ratio between paid and unpaid volunteers, and where those “paid” ones come from if we want to make sure the companies sponsoring the work get also the credit.</li><li><strong>Leader Identification:</strong> Who are the unsung heroes of each WordPress component, i.e. those who are always commenting on threads regarding that component and whose opinion is usually accepted? If we identify them, we could somehow use them as leaders in that area.</li><li><strong>Governance Model:</strong> How do we manage the contributions? Is it fair? Is it fast? Is it encouraging people to contribute more? Less? “Who decides what and when” is an important influence (or barrier) for potential new contributors.</li><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Is the governance model explicit enough? Do only those “inside” really know “how things work?”</li><li><strong>Toxicity/Quality of Conversations:</strong> Are our discussions threads friendly enough? Are new opinions heard or immediately shut down? Is the code of conduct enforced?</li><li><strong>Diversity Analysis:</strong> Is our community diverse enough?</li><li><strong>Temporal Analysis:</strong> We cannot rely on a static picture of dynamic community processes; many of the questions above need to be analyzed over time to detect trends.</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-resources-and-allocation-how-would-proposals-be-funded-and-executed\">Resources and Allocation: How Would Proposals Be Funded and Executed?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Following a Community-wide Call for Proposals that generates many well-defined, actionable research ideas, we could pursue the resources needed to make the research studies a reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Research contributions could be part of the Five for the Future program so companies can decide to contribute by sponsoring researchers alongside other types of contributions.</li><li>We could start with a simpler process where either companies themselves choose and sponsor a research team, or a new “WordPress research committee” channels funding to a specific research team. (This would be the same as existing company-sponsored individual contributors.)</li><li>If we see a WordPress research initiative grow, we could move to a more “formal” model (under the WordPress foundation perhaps) where we ask teams to submit proposals (that fit in the challenges we choose for that year) — and then we choose projects based on a number of standard criteria for evaluating scientific proposals. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>We Want Your Feedback!</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have ideas for a WordPress research project?

This avatar’s history is then available for the new_avatar activities to display the avatar the user had when these were published.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users will also notice a new &#8220;Recycle&#8221; tab inside the change profile photo UI that lets them manage and delete previously uploaded avatars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other notable additions include updates to the BuddyPress administration UI, with screens that match the layout WordPress uses for its tabbed screens like Site Health or Privacy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 10.0.0 introduces a new BuddyPress Add-Ons tab on the &#8220;Add Plugins&#8221; admin screen where users can find stable BP Components or BP Blocks that are maintained by the BuddyPress development team. These are features they have decided to keep independent from core but want to make more widely available in the plugin directory. The BP Search Block is the first to be displayed on this screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />BuddyPress Add-Ons</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This release updates the BP Theme Compatibility API so that BuddyPress content is compatible with FSE in WordPress 5.9.

In many ways, what you’ll find in 5.9 is just the beginning of various pieces of functionality and, by the end of the post, you too should see why.<br /><br />For now, keep in mind two things: it’s impossible to estimate when the following items will be implemented and these are just a <em>few</em> of many exciting things being explored.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-61f1af51382db wp-block-group has-light-background-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-sortabrilliant-guidepost\"><ul><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#robust-block-theme-switching\">Robust block theme switching</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#switch-between-built-in-style-variations-with-block-themes\">Switch between built in style variations with block themes</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#create-more-types-of-templates\">Create more types of templates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#updated-color-picker-experience\">Updated color picker experience</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#save-and-schedule-changes-in-the-site-editor\">Save and schedule changes in the site editor</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#find-patterns-in-more-places\">Find patterns in more places</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#more-controls-for-more-customization\">More controls for more customization</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#expanded-locking-capabilities-to-offer-more-curated-experiences\">Expanded locking capabilities to offer more curated experiences</a></li></ul></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"robust-block-theme-switching\">Robust block theme switching</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While 5.9 marks the exciting <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/block-themes/\">introduction of block themes</a>, the power of this new approach to themes doesn’t stop there, especially when you think about what will be possible across different block themes. For example, imagine a world where one could seamlessly take patterns from one theme, styling from another, and templates from yet another to create a site. Or imagine being able to switch themes while retaining your favorite palette of colors and typography. This is all being explored! To learn more, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2021/10/08/adventures-in-block-theme-switching/\">check out this wonderful design dive</a> from a Core contributor on the design team.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"switch-between-built-in-style-variations-with-block-themes\">Switch between built in style variations with block themes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, each block theme comes with one set of styles and settings bundled in a theme.json file. In the future, block themes can be bundled with multiple Style options, allowing you to switch between vastly different looks without changing themes. In the future, after finding one you like, you could then customize your site further using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/styles-overview/\">Styles system</a> in place from 5.9! This could radically change the experience of exploring and using themes, perhaps allowing you to use Styles from one theme in a different one or allowing theme authors to ship new Style variations as updates to their theme. All of this begs the question of how the theme directory can be reimagined to highlight how there are almost multiple themes built into each block theme thanks to these different variations. There&#8217;s both a ton to be figured out here and to look forward to. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see this concept demonstrated in the following video pulled from the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/10/06/introducing-twenty-twenty-two/\">Introducing Twenty Twenty-Two post</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>To stay on top of this work, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35619\">check out this PR currently underway</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"create-more-types-of-templates\">Create more types of templates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While WordPress 5.9 allows you to add some types of templates, there are numerous others that folks are keen to build. For example, what if you wanted a custom template for a specific category of posts or for a custom post type? These are all different types of templates to explore adding to the site editor! To see what types of templates are being explored, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/37407\">check out this GitHub issue on the topic</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"updated-color-picker-experience\">Updated color picker experience</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With more color options coming to WordPress, the color panel is getting a makeover to ensure it’s even easier to customize for all the various blocks that make use of this functionality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Current design</em></p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/vX5UFoR1_XnXChT7yYUd2Sdr6djGOlZAwE8jRy_xF9HT06eqg2fmQ688cVde1g6gMgsE0BhU09BrVPsPeymljRMHWzQwelVIZbXFrwIpF4ATI3pt2o85kvr9rUlbY6UVF6eUPtga\" alt=\"Current color picker experience showing only one color option rather than all.\" width=\"527\" height=\"456\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Upcoming design&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kszCKaLN1RbIcOqY-6TNDVIZP4ywmoWmVmRd0W2yV9Ho1F_ogNuZqob9mkg3m57mNu-9CYHARgMlWmktyh512e2HkO8ywRKMccuFtjQazykLFlgWf5LQIxAp6cD_xKyBSvLrpfbn\" alt=\"Upcoming color picker experience, showing a panel off to the side and each color listed clearly in the sidebar.\" width=\"614\" height=\"370\" />\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, with this new experience, it makes better use of the sidebar and it allows you to see&nbsp;the current choices at a glance.

Currently, in the site editor, this isn’t yet possible but is being planned. To stay up to date with this work, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/29575\">check out this issue</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"find-patterns-in-more-places\">Find patterns in more places</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/block-pattern/\">Block Patterns</a> are a powerful way to quickly build beautiful content. While patterns can be bundled with themes and there’s a new modal for exploring patterns, lots of work remains to have patterns appear right when you need them. For a sampling of enhancements to look forward to, check out the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/36350\">Add shortcuts to access the pattern explorer</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/36697\">Prioritize patterns on quick inserter instead of blocks at the root of templates</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/28739\">Increase prominence of contextual patterns when template editing</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/34123\">Explore &#8220;Site Branding&#8221; patterns for Site Title, Site Logo, Site Tagline</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/27575\">Connecting patterns with specific contexts &amp; transforms</a>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To connect some dots, if all of these were implemented today, you could do things like create a new template and be presented with patterns built into the experience that include blocks you’re likely to use like a navigation block, site title, and site logo put together in various options to pick from. Don’t like what you see? You could then use the transform menu to pick something else.&nbsp;All of this should streamline site creation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"more-controls-for-more-customization\">More controls for more customization</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While WordPress 5.9 includes a ton more customization options for blocks, there are even more to come. You can learn more about what’s planned in <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/28356\">this overview issue</a>. With each added control to each block comes an infinite number of possible combinations. Here’s just a brief taste of what you’ll be able to do with 5.9 to help give you a sense of what will be possible going forward too:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"expanded-locking-capabilities-to-offer-more-curated-experiences\">Expanded locking capabilities to offer more curated experiences</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While more options lead to excitement for some folks, questions of locking down the experience come up for others. WordPress 5.9 introduces a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/01/08/locking-blocks-in-wordpress-5-9/\">new block level locking mechanism to work alongside template locking</a> that helps set this foundation but know that there’s more to come. Imagine creating a custom pattern for a client and ensuring it’s locked in a way so that the content can be edited and the entire pattern can be moved around but the blocks within it can’t be removed. Or imagine you help set up a site for a client and you want to ensure some key information about their business (like opening hours) both can’t be removed or moved but can be updated as needed. This is the sort of functionality this work allows. It also ties directly into Phase 3 of the roadmap (collaborative editing) so expect much of this work to be explored and aligned as Phase 3 gets underway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a practical example of what’s possible today, check out this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matias_ventura/status/1445002647732375560\">awesome tweet from Matías Ventura</a>. As for what will be possible tomorrow?

Checklists. While there are differences in their purposes, their output is essentially the same. They are lists of items with boxes to tick off, and a plugin like David Towoju&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/todo-block/\">Todo Block</a> allows users to create them.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/todo-block/\">Todo Block</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I first downloaded and installed the plugin two weeks ago, but it had a problem. It did not seem to add any blocks at all. This was likely some mistake with porting the plugin over from its development repository. I have been testing it since its update a few days ago and like where it is headed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically, the plugin has two blocks. One exists for the outer list container and the other for the inner list items.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding a todo list.\n\n\n\n<p>It works similarly to the standard List block. Once users insert the Todo block into the post, they can add tasks. Hitting the <code>Enter</code> key creates a new item.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can customize the typography and colors for individual Todo Item blocks. The latter is a welcome option for people who categorize items or tasks by color.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Color coding items by category.\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are no such options on the outer Todo List block. More often than not, users might want to customize everything at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each item can also be set to &#8220;Read Only&#8221; or &#8220;Disabled.&#8221; Since this plugin does not send data through a form on the front end, the differences between the two are subtle. Site visitors cannot check a read-only field, but they can focus on them via mouse or keyboard. They can do neither for disabled items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it seems like I was touting a similar plugin not that long ago, it is <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/create-a-publishing-task-list-with-the-todo-list-block\">because I was</a>. In July 2021, Rich Tabor released the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/todo-list-block/\">Todo List Block</a> plugin. The primary difference between them is that Tabor&#8217;s is an editor-only plugin. He built the block as a tool for his publishing flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/15005\">checklist block feature request</a> in the Gutenberg repository. However, there has been no indication of work on it since 2019. Matias Ventura shared a <a href=\"https://cloudup.com/crwihuioLVq\">concept via video</a> in April of that year. Ella van Durpe followed up with a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/17957\">pull request</a> in October. Since then, only a few people have commented. The concept may be too niche to ever land in WordPress, despite my desire for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the reasons I want to see such a block in core WordPress is because it would be handy for various patterns. I have already built several for recipe and food bloggers, and I used the Todo Block plugin to test the concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Recipe ingredients list using the Todo Block plugin.\n\n\n\n<p>There are two features really missing in the plugin. The first is a <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element wrapping the checkbox and text. Adding this would allow checking the box on the front end by clicking the text or the checkbox itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second is crossing out each item as it is checked. Some systems also gray out tasks as they are finished. A &#8220;task complete&#8221; indicator is a relatively standard feature for todo list apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than that, Todo Block is a plugin that I could see myself using for some projects. At the very least, I could handle the crossed-out style through my theme&#8217;s stylesheet.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-tavern-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A question to our readers:</strong> I am trying something different with this post.

Well, except for the spammers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But spam plagues every single website, no matter its size. It shows up in comments, contact form submissions, and user registrations. And not only is it annoying and time-consuming to deal with, it can be damaging for your reputation and your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do you prevent it? Let’s take a closer look at spam, learn why a plugin is your best solution, and compare the best anti-spam plugins for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-2206\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-spam-and-why-does-it-matter\">What is spam and why does it matter?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In its simplest form, spam is unwanted commercial communication. Typically, for you as a website owner, spam looks like irrelevant, strange comments on posts, pages, products, or form submissions. Not only is it annoying, but it also makes you look unprofessional, negatively affects your search engine rankings, and can even direct site visitors and customers to malware and phishing sites. You want to prevent it as much as possible to protect both your reputation and your site visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-can-anti-spam-plugins-prevent-spam\">How can anti-spam plugins prevent spam?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can, of course, manually <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/comment-moderation/\" target=\"_blank\">moderate each comment</a> and delete any and all spam. However, spammers can leave dozens —&nbsp;and sometimes hundreds —&nbsp;of spam comments each day on a single website. That can be very time-consuming and also leaves a lot of room for error. You have better things to spend your time on!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why WordPress anti-spam plugins are so helpful and why we’ve covered the best WordPress anti-spam solutions in the industry. They automatically filter through each and every one of your comments (and sometimes form submissions) and delete spam for you. You don’t waste any time, but you know that this critical task is taken care of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do they do this? Well, spammers aren’t typically very clever. They leave valuable clues in their comments, such as misspellings, strange links, and sales pitches. Anti-spam plugins have a database of this information and use it to identify and get rid of spam without you having to lift a finger.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"important-features-of-anti-spam-plugins\">Important features of anti-spam plugins</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a variety of anti-spam plugins out there. How do you know which one is the right fit for your website?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some important features of anti-spam plugins:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-prevents-both-comment-and-contact-form-spam\">1. Prevents both comment and contact form spam</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Spam doesn’t just happen in the comment section of your site. Spambots can take advantage of contact forms and use them to send out spam emails to your email list or customers. Plus, tons of spam contact form submissions in your inbox every day is frustrating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, make sure that your anti-spam plugin protects both your comment forms <em>and </em>contact forms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-integrates-with-the-other-tools-you-use\">2. Integrates with the other tools you use</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re adding an anti-spam plugin to an existing WordPress site, it’s especially important that it works well with the plugins you already have installed. This might include contact form plugins (like Jetpack, Contact Form 7, or WPForms), forum plugins like bbPress, or eCommerce plugins like WooCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-has-a-powerful-database-of-spam-information-and-identifiers\">3. Has a powerful database of spam information and identifiers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to correctly identify spam, plugins need to have lots of information. They need to have observed spam on lots and lots of sites for a long time so they can identify common characteristics. After all, you want real comments to stick around, but the bad ones to disappear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"4-doesn-t-require-a-captcha-or-other-form-of-validation\">4. Doesn’t require a CAPTCHA or other form of validation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re probably familiar with CAPTCHAs — tools that make you check a box or select all the photos with stop signs to prove you’re not a robot. While they’re relatively easy to use, they’re just one extra step that someone has to take in order to reach out to you or engage with your content. And every single step makes it more likely that they’ll get frustrated or distracted and give up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, ideally, you’ll want to go with a solution that doesn’t require CAPTCHAs to make the user experience as seamless as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"5-allows-you-to-moderate-alongside-it\">5. Allows you to moderate alongside it</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While a high-quality anti-spam plugin is extremely accurate, it’s not perfect. There may be times that it incorrectly identifies a valid comment as spam or misses a spam comment. So, if comments are extra valuable to your website, you may want to be able to override the decisions your anti-spam tool makes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"6-doesn-t-require-you-to-do-much-work\">6. Doesn’t require you to do much work</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, though, you shouldn’t <em>have </em>to put any effort into spam prevention. Once you set up the plugin, you should be able to sit back, relax, and know that spam is taken care of.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"7-is-easy-to-set-up\">7. Is easy to set up</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Installing and setting up the plugin should be super simple, even if you don’t have much tech experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"8-doesn-t-weigh-down-your-site\">8. Doesn’t weigh down your site</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t want a plugin that adds a lot of extra weight to your server, slowing things down. That’ll only make things more difficult for site visitors and hurt your SEO rankings. Make sure that the plugin you choose keeps things speedy. Typically, an anti-spam plugin does this by running all operations on its own server, rather than on your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-best-anti-spam-plugins-for-wordpress\">The best anti-spam plugins for WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-akismet\">1. <a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">Akismet</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet is the anti-spam plugin created specifically for WordPress by the team behind WordPress.com.

They’re programmed to fill out any required fields and can even be taught to look like legitimate users. Then, they search the web for sites that meet certain requirements and leave as many spam comments as they can.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-can-i-identify-a-spam-comment\">How can I identify a spam comment?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some typical qualities of spam comments:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>They’re generic. They can apply to any site or any piece of content. E.G. “Nice post!”</li><li>They’re irrelevant. They often have nothing to do with the post they’re on.</li><li>They have fake names. The name might be something like “cheap designer handbags” rather than a real person’s name.</li><li>They’re poorly written. They may contain a lot of grammatical and spelling errors or be a jumble of words.</li><li>They link to suspicious websites. You can hover over any embedded links to view the URL without clicking on it.</li><li>They contain inappropriate words. This may include profanity or offensive language.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-default-wordpress-settings-can-help-with-spam\">What default WordPress settings can help with spam?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a variety of WordPress settings that help prevent spam. If you take all of the steps below, you’ll maximize spam prevention. However, not all of these settings will be right for every website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by going to <strong>Settings → Discussion</strong> in your WordPress dashboard. Then:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Check the box next to “Comment author must fill out name and email”</li><li>Check the box next to “Users must be registered and logged in to comment”</li><li>Check the box next to “Comment must be manually approved”</li><li>Under “Comment moderation”, add “1” to the box in the sentence “Hold a comment in the queue if it contains ___ or more links”</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, if you start to see common phrases, URLS, emails, etc. in your spam comments, add them to the box under “Comment moderation”. This will block any comments that include those characteristics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"can-i-manually-moderate-spam-in-wordpress\">Can I manually moderate spam in WordPress?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, absolutely. By default, WordPress allows you to go through each comment and decide to mark it as spam or approve it. However, it can take a lot of time to go through comments on a daily or weekly basis —&nbsp;time better spent invested in your blog or business!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"should-i-enable-comments-on-my-site\">Should I enable comments on my site?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This completely depends on your site and goals. In many cases, comments can be an excellent way to answer questions, encourage discussion, and engage with your site visitors. They can even be used to create a community around your brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this may not be right for every website. If you do choose to disable comments, you can do so in your <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/support/comments/#in-settings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WordPress Discussion settings</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-goal-of-spammers\">What is the goal of spammers?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some reasons people leave spam comments:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>To generate backlinks that improve search engine rankings. Their hope is that links to their own site will show Google that they’re valuable and legitimate. However, this strategy typically doesn’t work.</li><li>To direct visitors to malicious websites. A lot of spam comments will link to suspicious sites designed to capture information for nefarious purposes.&nbsp;</li><li>To increase traffic or sales on another site. Spam comments may link to perfectly legitimate websites, with the goal of increasing ad views (and revenue) or generating more product sales.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-can-i-disable-comments-on-individual-posts\">How can I disable comments on individual posts?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There may be times that you want to turn off comments for one particular post rather than all of the posts or pages on your site. All you have to do is go to <strong>Posts → All Posts </strong>in your WordPress dashboard and click on the one you want to edit. Then, click the gear icon at the top right of the page and expand the <strong>Discussion </strong>section. Uncheck the box next to <strong>Allow Comments, </strong>then save your post.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-do-i-find-comments-that-are-in-moderation-in-wordpress\">How do I find comments that are in moderation in WordPress?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your comment moderation queue lists all of the comments that need your approval before they go live on your site. This is your chance to either mark them as spam, publish them on your site, or delete them entirely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find the WordPress comment moderation section, click on <strong>Comments</strong> in your WordPress dashboard. All unmoderated comments will appear with a yellow background and red bar on the left. Underneath each comment, you can choose to approve, reply, edit, trash, or mark the comment as spam.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 11:05:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Simon Keating\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:112:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 12.4 Includes Accessibility Improvements, Categories Reminder, and a Tag Cloud Outline Style\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=128613\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:265:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-12-4-includes-accessibility-improvements-categories-reminder-and-a-tag-cloud-outline-style?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gutenberg-12-4-includes-accessibility-improvements-categories-reminder-and-a-tag-cloud-outline-style\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7042:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Gutenberg 12.4 landed in the WordPress plugin directory <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/01/19/whats-new-in-gutenberg-12-4-19-january/\">earlier today</a>. With the push to get WordPress 5.9 out the door next week, it can be easy to forget all the development behind the scenes, waiting to make its appearance in future versions of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest release focuses more on polishing existing features and introducing a few nice-to-haves. Accessibility improvements are always a welcome sight. The update adds an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/37357\">always-available close button</a> in the block inserter for screen readers.  And, when closing the list view,  the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/37798\">focus state moves to its button</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some theme-related blocks have also been <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/37723\">relocated within the inserter</a>. Post Template, Pagination, Next Page, Previous Page, and Page Numbers were previously housed under the Design category. Now, they are appropriately under Theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"broken-site-editor-when-opening-block-inserter\">Broken Site Editor When Opening Block Inserter</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Scrollbars gone wrong in site editor.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Gutenberg 12.4 seems to introduce a new bug inside of the site editor. When opening the block inserter, its scrollbar does not appear. This creates a long list of blocks down the side of the page. The canvas area gets set to a fixed height with its own scrollbar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This issue does not prevent inserting blocks. Nor does it make the site editor unusable. It is more of an annoyance than anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This creates a big usability issue. If you try to insert a block after scrolling beyond the height of the content canvas, you cannot see where it gets added until scrolling back up the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also other scrollbar-related issues. The Site Logo and Image blocks <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/38086\">have them in the site editor</a>, and the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/37573\">problem is the same for patterns</a> in the inserter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Anne McCarthy for being a second set of eyes, confirming this issue, and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/38098\">reporting it</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"categories-added-to-the-pre-publish-checklist\">Categories Added to the Pre-Publish Checklist</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Assigning a category before publishing.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Categories now have their own <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/37703\">section in the pre-publish panel</a> for posts. If the user has not selected one, a new tab will appear that reads, &#8220;Suggestion: Assign a category.&#8221; The user can then open it and check any they want to add to the post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a fan of this addition. Even as someone who writes daily, I must routinely remind myself to select a category for my posts. Meta information like this is something I always leave to the end of the writing process, and it is nice to have a reminder. I would also welcome a featured image check.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"post-excerpt-and-content-block-transforms\">Post Excerpt and Content Block Transforms</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Transforming Post Content block to Post Excerpt.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">This is one of my favorite enhancements in the Gutenberg 12.4 release. Users can now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/37651\">transform Post Content to the Post Excerpt block</a> and vice versa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my complaints with Automattic&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattics-livro-is-a-minimal-block-theme-for-writers\">recent Livro theme</a> was that it shows the full post content instead of excerpts on its blog and archive pages. I had to remove the Post Content block and insert Post Excerpt to change it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is relatively easy for someone as familiar with the site editor as me. However, some users could unintentionally put the replacement block in the wrong place and mess up their entire layout. With the ability to transform the blocks, they can do it with just a couple of mouse clicks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"outline-style-for-tag-cloud-block\">Outline Style for Tag Cloud Block</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Outline block style.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The latest release adds a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/37092\">Outline style for the Tag Cloud block</a>. I have said it multiple times, but it might be worth repeating. I dislike Gutenberg adding in too many new block styles. It feels like theme territory. The core system should focus on the foundational features, and themers should extend it with custom options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not that I dislike the outline design for tags. It was the first custom style I added for the Tag Cloud block when designing my own theme. However, every new block style adds some potential burden to theme authors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of those issues is that themes need to support it. For example, the padding used for the Tag Cloud links is too large for some theme designs. It is a hardcoded value, so designers must explicitly overwrite it to tone it down. Alternatively, they must deregister the block style if they do not want to make it available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to leave some fun things for third-party developers to implement. Otherwise, themes become less and less relevant.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"paragraph-font-family-support-removed\">Paragraph Font Family Support Removed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">After happily reporting font-family support for the Paragraph block in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-12-3-introduces-new-blocks-design-options-and-a-complete-core-blocks-reference\">Gutenberg 12.3</a>, it is disheartening to lose it in a mere two-week span. Developers <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/37815\">reverted the recent change</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andy Peatling cited a few reasons behind the decision <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34064#issuecomment-959384115\">in another ticket</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>We should keep font family as an option if it exists, but it should not be the default for any blocks.</li><li>We don&#8217;t yet have a good way to add custom fonts, so it&#8217;s quite limited.</li><li>Once we have a better fonts API we can surface this more in blocks that are more likely to need font family changes (site title being an obvious one).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The web fonts API was slated to land in WordPress 5.9, but it was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/proposed-web-fonts-api-not-coming-to-wordpress-5-9-possibly-landing-in-gutenberg-first\">punted to a future version</a> in November 2021. Work on the project is now ongoing <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36394\">within the Gutenberg repository</a>. Until it is complete, font-family options for any new blocks will likely stall until the new API is in place.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 02:20:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: Why Aren’t More WordPress Theme Authors Creating Block Themes?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=128509\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:187:\"https://wptavern.com/what-arent-more-wordpress-theme-authors-creating-block-themes?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=what-arent-more-wordpress-theme-authors-creating-block-themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7966:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/\">Block themes</a> are trickling into the official WordPress Themes Directory at a slow rate ahead of full-site editing&#8217;s debut in WordPress 5.9. There are now 39 themes that support site editing features, up from 28 in December 2021, when Matt Mullenweg commented on it during the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2021-wordpress-passes-43-market-share-looks-to-expand-the-commons-through-openverse\">State of the Word</a> address.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“That needs to be 5,000,” Mullenweg said. Later during the presentation he said he hopes that WordPress will “have 300 or ideally 3,000 of these block themes” before entering the Collaboration phase of the Gutenberg project.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Why the strong push towards kickstarting the block theme market? The upcoming 5.9 release is set to deliver a solid set of groundbreaking design tools in core that will change WordPress website building in a major way. These include editing page layouts with a drag-and-drop interface and a new Global Styles interface for changing&nbsp;typography, colors, sizes, layouts, padding, and other aspects of design. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users cannot take advantage of all these new features without a block theme. That&#8217;s why WordPress 5.9 is introducing a new default theme, Twenty Twenty-Two, that will make it easy for anyone to get started using a block theme. But with just 39 block themes available right now, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/ask-the-bartender-are-there-any-compact-and-personal-block-themes\">early adopters haven&#8217;t found a lot of variety</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For whatever reason, more than 5 million WordPress users have still not transitioned to the block editor and are using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">Classic Editor</a> plugin. This experience is a shadow of what WordPress has become since the block editor made its debut in 5.0 more than three years ago. Even among users who have embraced the block editor, FSE early adopters are few and far between.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why aren&#8217;t theme authors creating block themes to have their products become some of the first on the market? WordPress Themes Team Representative Ganga Kafle jumped into this topic yesterday, asking why theme authors continue to make classic themes instead of getting on the block theme train.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dear theme authors,<br />Why you are not submitting block themes in WordPress as you submit classic themes on a regular basis? <br />What are the reasons behind it? Please comment below. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/block?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#block</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/themes?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#themes</a></p>&mdash; KafleG (@sandilyakafle) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sandilyakafle/status/1483437345643048964?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 18, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Responses showed that theme developers have a variety of different motivations for holding out on building block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I asked some local agencies here in Cape Town, and some of them indicated workflow &#8211; in that they were extremely efficient at creating sites with &#8216;their&#8217; theme, and making a new block theme would eat into profits,&#8221; Automattic Theme Development Team Lead Jeffrey Pearce said. &#8220;They are waiting to see block themes &#8216;mature.\'&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once 5.9 is released and FSE themes are officially supported, agencies will likely become more motivated to update their workflows to develop block themes more efficiently. During this in-between time, it&#8217;s easier to maintain the status quo, but now is the time to get prepared to hit the ground running. Once users know there is more to WordPress, they won&#8217;t want to be limited by a classic theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some theme developers, it&#8217;s a matter of not having the skills yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There is a learning curve but I expect more and more people will start building and submitting block themes,&#8221; WordPress consultant Krasen Slavov said. &#8220;I am personally eager to experiment and learn, but since it is a totally new way of building themes and we all need first to pay the bills, this should be in my spare time.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress developer Sallie Goetsch, who said she builds themes for clients and not for the WordPress directory, is  also eager to make the jump into FSE but has the same learning needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While I definitely plan to switch to FSE, there&#8217;s a lot for me to learn and experiment with before I&#8217;m confident enough to use it in production,&#8221; Goetsch said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other theme developers cited difficulties keeping up with the ever-changing landscape of FSE theme development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t keep up with the changes,&#8221; CSS Igniter co-founder Gerasimos Tsiamalos said.  &#8220;It&#8217;s miles away from offering something other than dead simple themes. [There are] too many inconsistencies to streamline.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the nature of their day-to-day work load, some theme developers do not perceive early adoption of FSE themes as a practical move at this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very happy using blocks for posts, but block enabled themes don&#8217;t give us the flexibility we need to build pages at the speed required,&#8221; Designs43 agency responded.  &#8220;And there are too many changes to keep up with also. We tend to use a fairly basic theme and put customizations into the child.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I guess the missing flexibility is a killer feature for theme authors,&#8221; WordPress theme developer Jessica Lyschik said. &#8220;It‘s very easy to bump into things that just don‘t work at all or yet.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The demand for block themes is not easy to measure. A conservative estimate of active installs of FSE themes hosted on WordPress.org is ~3,000 sites, based on the stats for the small number available. Once the world is introduced to WordPress 5.9 next week, that number is likely to shoot up overnight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We have a few free FSE themes and working on a premium one,&#8221; WordPress Theme shop owner Ana Segota said. &#8220;I love themes are more design now and they are easier to use but it&#8217;s still a long way. We need to find a way to educate users about the new way of building websites and also it&#8217;s hard to follow all the changes.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although block theme development is still in its infancy, there are a few educational resources for authors who are ready to take the plunge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus Kazmierczak published a brief <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/01/04/block-themes-a-new-way-to-build-themes-in-wordpress-5-9/\">introduction to building block themes</a>, which links to helpful resources from the Block Editor Handbook. Most notably, these include an <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/block-theme-overview/\">overview of block themes</a>, how to <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/create-block-theme/\">create a block theme</a>, and a guide to <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/theme-json/\">Global Settings and Styles (theme.json)</a>.

Thanks to, um, whenever a lot of the podcasts that I\'m doing now, it\'s like, forget to turn off slack and they get that one slack notification. I go, oh crap. All six people that listen to me, whatever how many people it is. They\'ll they\'ll just go did I just get a slack notification while I was out running and listening to this podcast?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Exactly. It\'s like, I, I always check and see if I just got the notification, but no, it was in the, it was in the podcast, somebody else\'s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> So the reason why Michelle, you and I are talking here today and has nothing to do with blackmail. It has more to do though with what we want to share with our Post Status listeners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, everybody\'s doing these posts or visions of what\'s coming in 2022. And with Post Status, we\'ve got a good pulse. On the community, what they\'re hoping to see what they are doing and what they probably will be looking for in 2022. I think you and I are in a good position. To talk about some of these things that post that is, is particularly planning to help out the [00:01:00] WordPress community in particular, the WordPress professionals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I thought that was a good way to kind of get the year started so people can mark these on their calendar. Although if you go to poststatus.com/events, it\'s there to. But let\'s, let\'s say, where do you want to start in terms of what we\'re planning for Post Status in 22? Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> So what are the things? So when I joined Post Status, uh, last, was it fall, I guess October-ish, uh, you know, Corey and I had talked about some different things in ways for me to be involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And part of that was writing about, um, the job situation, whether it\'s about helping people with resumes or, you know, a lot of the, you can see a lot of the posts that I\'ve put together. Um, the Post Status.com site. About hiring and also about getting hired. We also have a great, um, you know, podcasts. We\'ve got a whole season out there from get hired.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I with Courtney and Corey about, um, getting hired in, in WordPress and, you know, Courtney does a lot of our training and things like that. And some of the ideas that I had coming in were not just writing about [00:02:00] underrepresented, underrepresented topics and job topics, but like, Hey, let\'s take this kind of thing to the next level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s actually do some event. That we can get the, they, uh, not only the Post Status community involved with, with the whole WordPress community as well. And some of those things are, the WP career summit that we\'ve been talking about, which I\'m building the website. I promise it\'s getting done this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> it\'s a summit, Michelle. I mean, these things take time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> I know, but like, I should have a landing page at least. Right. So that\'s what I\'m working on, um, is WP career summit.com by the time this airs, it should be out there. So go to WP career summit.com and you can learn about what we\'re planning to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is the first ever summit or conference about working in WordPress specifically. And the goal is two tracks. We\'ll have two tracks, it\'ll run, uh, through the course of the day. One for employers and how to do better, hiring how to do better at evaluate, [00:03:00] evaluating applicants, how to do better recruiting, how to recruit for, you know, inclusion and . Diversity, how to do things without tokenization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, how to evaluate, um, international. Applicants and those kinds of things. So we\'re working on getting together some really good speakers that will speak to employers, but the other track is for job seekers. So if you are looking for a job in WordPress or tech, what are some things that will be helpful to you, understanding how to build a resume for technology, understanding how to put together your GitHub repo, to make sure that people can see the work that you\'re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you build a portfolio? what social media should you be involved in? How do you make sure that you have a good LinkedIn profile?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Not looking for a job and I feel like I got to go off and do that now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Talk to me later, I\'ll help you, but having a career summit like that, where not only do we have those two tracks, but we will have 12 sponsors, uh, [00:04:00] working with us that day, who will have tables.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, similar, if you\'ve been to WordPress, we\'re going to actually use the word Fest setup. We\'ve hired out, uh, Dan maybe, and his crew to create that same environment for us to use for the WP career summit. So you\'ll have the tracks, you\'ll be able to watch the videos as they\'re, as they are, do live Q and A\'s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then you\'ll also be able to go to this open space and meet up with the different employers who are sponsoring to learn more about their companies and maybe even, you know, give them your resume and set up a time to do an interview. We\'ll also have an online career fair at the same time. So any company that wants to sponsor at a smaller level will be able to have, um, their career page, their recruiting page, specifically linked on our job fair sites so that they have a better opportunity to recruit anybody who\'s in attendance at the WP career summit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal behind the career summit is to really bring together employers and potential employees and to [00:05:00] educate the whole WordPress space and best practices for hiring and best practices for getting hired and really start those conversations. There\'s not a lot of conversations. There\'s a ton of people posting jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s a ton of people saying I need a job. It\'s the idea of bringing all those things together and helping the people who are hiring of the people who are looking to get together in the same space, um, and hopefully fill each other\'s needs by getting some great employees into those, into those offices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I think one of the advantages of this will be, and maybe this is just a tip from somebody who\'s looked for jobs before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\'re aware of a summit, usually it was in the context of a physical conference, but regardless if it\'s physical or, or remote or virtual. If, you know, in advance, who\'s going to be there. Um, it\'s also, if, if you\'re serious baby, maybe it\'s, um, maybe it\'s maybe you are, have a particular company in mind, or maybe you heard this company\'s really, really good to work for, or they have exciting projects or they [00:06:00] get good PR or whatever, whatever floats your boat in terms of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have there\'s this opportunity, especially through Post Status slack to reach out to them prior to. To the summit and say, listen, I would love to talk to you at this summit about this. I just want to make sure that, you know, do an initial contact, nothing fancy in my opinion. But if you really think that you have a good shot at getting, if you want to be noticed, like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, it is one of those tips where in this situation, where if, if someone remembers your resume and they\'re comparing that with other people for position, somebody says, well, what w you know, which one of these was most eager? If that question ever came up, you would, it would be at least an advantage to say, this person reached out to me prior, even before coming to the summit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They wanted to speak to us. And they were very interested who knows that could be the edge and there\'s nothing, there\'s no rule that says you can\'t talk to these people. Until you get to the summit. I think the summits, the best [00:07:00] place to have properly a deep conversation, but just like these days, it\'s whatever it takes sometimes to get noticed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think, I think your summit is going to be set up very, very well for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Cool. I mean, do you think about when, when you\'re mountain climbing, they talk about somebody like you\'re climbing Everest, for example, they don\'t talk about. Being at the summit until you\'re actually at the top. Right? So it\'s a process you\'re climbing, you\'re getting to that point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there\'s plenty of opportunity to do that both on your way up and after the summit as well. So, um, the summit should be that focal point where everything kind of comes together, but there\'s lots that you can do in advance. And there\'s lots that you can do as follow up afterwards, for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> You can\'t really relate to the closest thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can relate to that as I got on top one time of a big pile of leaves in my yard and I was out of breath. So I, if it\'s the same thing as that, I can definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Well, don\'t you work in your basement. I mean, you got to climb the stairs, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Well, yeah. Yes. I\'m not up to that. I\'m not, I don\'t have one of those elevator sit in a [00:08:00] chair and it takes me up things yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although my wife that is that is, could potential 20th anniversary gift. I\'ll just slip that to my wife. I\'m in the DMS. I</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> dunno. I just saw Gremlin\'s again, recently rewatched around the holidays. And that thing was pretty scary, how I shot that we\'re going to right out the windows. So it just,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> if only it could go that fast, that would be awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, there are a lot of people I get constant emails or pings on slack or something that says, Hey, we\'re going to put this out there on Twitter. We know you\'re going to retweet it. Or do you happen to know a recommend someone for this? It was a lot of background chatter going around and I\'m, I\'m getting these requests, not just.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other employee, I\'m getting these requests from like, um, head people in head WordPress agencies that ping me just because we know each other. So there is, there, there is a lot of improvement and efficiency still, I think. And I think the summits kind of help with that. And if, even if you\'re not maybe looking forward to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. And it\'s [00:09:00] free to attend. It\'s free to attend the summit. We\'re not charging anything to be there. Um, the worst thing I think that you can do is when somebody is looking for a job is to say, Hey, pay to come learn about how to do better at getting jobs. So the sponsorship is going to cover all of the costs of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we want everybody who wants to be there. You don\'t have to say you\'re looking for a job or not, but you\'re welcome to kind of come in and observe either track and bounce back and forth. If you want to and learn best practices on either side of things. Uh it\'s uh, it\'s just there for edification for anybody who wants to learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Gotcha.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright. Job summit. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> So the other thing along that same lines though, is, um, starting, uh, so starting on January 12th. So this is, I think this is where Eric next week. So it\'ll have been a last week already. I\'m going to be doing weekly Twitter chats. About what\'s happening in, uh, jobs in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So most people are aware that every Wednesday [00:10:00] or I should say most Wednesdays, I tweet out a list of job openings that I\'m aware of in the WordPress space. And some of that comes, I\'ve created a site called WP career pages.com. Um, that was one of my, my pandemic projects during their initial lockdown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2020 was to create a site where people could just go and look at. For jobs and this pin up any of the career pages that are there and see what\'s available. So on Wednesdays, I go through, I pull, you know, 10 or 15 of those and I set up, send out a tweet saying, there\'s all these jobs. If you\'re interested in applying, you might want to apply for this job here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s that\'s up there. And I was approached by Daniel Schutzsmith asking if I thought that would be fun to do as a Twitter space. And so I piloted it just to see what would happen back in December, before the holidays and everything else. And we had quite a few people actually show up to hear what I had to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so. I start doing that on a weekly basis. It may be five minutes. It may be half an [00:11:00] hour. It depends on who joins me and what kinds of questions they have. But I will, at that point, talk through some of the openings that I\'ve seen and answer any questions that people have about getting hired and about resumes and anything else that they have to ask.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we\'ve kind of an open space on Twitter every Wednesday at 1:00 PM Eastern time, uh, as, for however long it lasts, but no more than a half an hour. Cause I do have a day job too. And we\'ll see how it goes. For sure. Um, but you\'ll be able to get to that, uh, through, uh, by, by looking at that events page that you mentioned, cause they\'re going to be listed there, but also just going to the post status, Twitter on Wednesdays at 1:00 PM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. Join that Twitter space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Yeah. Twitter space seems to be like, if you want a casual conversation, not so much formal, but yeah, I think that works out well. I\'ve had some experience with that as well. I would,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> if I\'m working from home, I might add pajamas, but you\'ll never know because it\'s audio only, right.[00:12:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Everybody goes to Dave\'s on audio. Thank God. All right. If David\'s audio only, only I\'ll go talk to him. I\'ll go see what Dave\'s doing. Sure. Why not? I\'m sure they\'ll work out. Fantastic. Yes. And again, if you go. I\'m going to put the link to the career pages. And I remember when you started doing this, um, the career pages, um, thing, and then on the Twitter every Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, we\'ll probably share link for one of the later last ones she did for that as well. That, to me, it\'s always great to have something consistent like that. I\'ve seen your stuff for Wednesday, for Wednesday after Wednesday after Wednesday. And I think if something ever drastically happened to my job situation, I would look and see when the next available Wednesday was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s like, okay, well I know on Wednesday, I\'m going to, yeah, well, I won\'t even have to think about it because it\'s all, it\'s all. It\'s, you\'re, you\'re very consistent on that and kudos, kudos to you for that. So I\'ll share the link for the career pages. The one of the law, one of the latter ones you did on Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, into the show notes too. Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> what\'s [00:13:00] interesting is, I mean, we can\'t see each other\'s Twitter analytics. Of course, you know, you can only see your own, uh, but I get anywhere from 3000 to 20,000 impressions on those Wednesday tweet threads, depending on who sees it, what\'s going on in the day. If there\'s a ton of, you know, other activities happening in the world, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and whoever\'s on Twitter and happens to retweet it, but. Uh, but yeah, we\'ve got as many as 20,000 impressions on those. So clearly they\'re hitting the mark and people are interested in seeing what\'s happening out there. And in the career field</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> these days, your situation can change at a moment\'s notice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think having a constant beacon every week, even if. This week, you\'re fine. Next week, who knows? Oh, or you could, or you could suddenly have inspiration to look for something better or different, you know,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> exactly. No judgment. There\'s no judgment,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> no judgment here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> They\'ve just been here. And then I had an interesting idea to do yet glutton for punishment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I put out as many conferences and things [00:14:00] I\'m on. Um, I\'m on the team for work camp Europe. I am on the word Fest team. Um, and I do a lot. The seller is seller WP, as far as, um, attending conference word camps and conferences. But I had an idea for another one. Which is, um, the people behind, Hey, Presto conference actually reached out to me and said, just want you to know, I know that you\'ve participated in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\'re not going to continue with the, Hey Presto, Twitter conferences anymore. They\'re just decided to go in a different direction. They\'re not going to do that. I said, Hey, would you mind if I picked up the reins and. Carried on doing something very similar and not necessarily the same exact thing that they were doing, but, um, along those lines, and they\'re like with our blessing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so May 24th, we will have the first ever, uh, online. Post status Twitter conference. And that will be May 24th. And it\'s going to run from 9:00 AM until I think, I can\'t remember 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM or something like that Eastern time. And I get central and Eastern. I [00:15:00] can\'t remember what I\'ve scheduled when I\'m, but just go to the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s there. We have it all there</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> All I know is it\'s bright outside therefore I\'m narrowing down what the time is. Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> But what it is is it\'s going to be an opportunity for people to present at a conference. Ha by creating a series of 15 tweets, you\'ll be assigned a particular point of time. During that day, every half hour, there will be a new presenter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first 15 minutes, they\'ll present a tweet a minute. And the second, 15 minutes of their half hour be Q and A and opportunity to have conversation. Uh, I\'m using the conference hashtag and then whatever, um, you know, um, mentioning the, uh, the particular presenter. I keep saying speaker, but you\'re not technically speaking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'re just presenting. Um, again, this is something you could do in your pajamas too, because it\'s Twitter do whatever you\'d like. So, but, but we will be organizing it as a conference and have official. You know, schedule of presenters during that day. And so we [00:16:00] have people already applying to speak, uh, sorry, present.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See, it\'s not easy to say. I have that</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should have a big word just printed across the screen. So I don\'t mess it up, but we have people already applying to present on different topics. Our, um, and I know you\'ve talked about this before, but as post status. Um, tenant for this year is give, grow together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that is also the theme of the Twitter conference. And so we\'re hoping that people will incorporate that into the topics that they apply to present so that we can make sure that we\'re all moving together forward giving and growing together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> You . What does that mean to you personally?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Um, I mean,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I think to me it seems to be a lot of what I already do, so I</p>\n\n\n\n<p>demonstrated you give a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> But I try to do it not in avoid. Right. So [00:17:00] I try to work with other people. That\'s why I\'ve joined Post Status. And that\'s why I\'m here. With everybody here. It\'s why I am the president of big Barnhart, because I like to do things with other people and to move the community forward and to be somebody who is hopefully a catalyst for good and for more, uh, people working with one another and to build better community and a more inclusive community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For sure. And so to me, give, grow together. Is about each of us giving what we can to grow the community and help each other grow individually and obviously doing it together so that we can, um, as one build the community to be as good as it possibly can be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Right. Looking for the, looking for the good in others and looking for the good in ourselves that we can share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means a positive influence on as many people as possible because. Uh, in an upbuilding way too, because obviously for the past couple of years, people sorely need uplifting, positive [00:18:00] momentum. And I mean, you know, have a great tech talk. That\'s fine. I, but you know, I get a feeling when word camps are fully, fully back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, there\'s going to be so many of these, um, touchy, feely, emotional dogs, where they were working at Miami. We always would sprinkle them out, you know, in, in various parts and get people motivated and stuff. Um, but now I think we need that. We need that motivation. We need that togetherness. Where we can get it, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s not, we\'re not waiting for this point in the year where we\'re either travel or don\'t, or watch it virtually or something. We need it where we can get it. Some people even need it on a daily basis sometimes to survive mentally. So I think this, I, I think it\'s something that, that, that should feel if there\'s any gap in somebody\'s wondering if they need to contribute or be on the receiving end to.[00:19:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of that pro and give. Go ahead and check out the conference. And the best part is, are using Twitter. So, I mean, you can, you can, you can leak and look at the celebrity gossip. And then there was a tweet from this conference. And then, you know,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> You dont even have to register because like what we can\'t gatekeeper Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s there\'s, there\'s no ticket selling Twitter</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> already has its claws in you. We\'re not asking for anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> We\'re just saying, go pay attention to this hashtag. And we will be turning each, um, each presentation, each presenter into Twitter moments so that we\'ll be able to have all of their, um, presentation in one space so that you\'ll be able to consume that at a later date, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, but you know, considering it live while it happens is even better because you could engage with the presenter and ask any questions that you have, um, which helps you at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Plus also, it also stops that nagging question that usually people ask ever after all the other conferences, what\'s your Twitter handle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:00] If I had a dime, I can say it a bunch of times. Well, that sounds fantastic. So let\'s see if I got this straight. We have the career summit. We have the, uh, live spaces. Um, I should say Twitter spaces for the, um, for the weekly WordPress jobs. And then we have the Twitter, um, conference happening. Remind me again, that what the date was May 24th, May 24th, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, at 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM. Currently as the time of this recording, 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern time on there. And that\'s what we have. That\'s what we have to willing to share right now to the public. Um, and right now, but if you want to S if you\'re listening to this and you want to see maybe the latest. Um, cause we\'re going to be adding to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, there\'s more coming down the road. You just can\'t tell me about it on a recording. That\'s fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> I actually had a conversation this morning about something that\'s probably coming up pretty soon that we\'re working on. So [00:21:00] that\'s all I\'m going to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Stop teasing me! stop teasing me</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> I\'ll DM you later, but yes, there definitely will be more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if there are things that you, dear, dear reader, dear listener.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> You say speaker and we always have to constant</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> gentle listener, whatever whoever\'s listening to us right now. If there are things that you think that we can be doing and doing better and ways that we can be meeting the needs of our community at plus status and the greater community, we want to hear about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\'ve got ideas, as a matter of fact, the idea that I was kicking around this morning with some of our. Post status people was brought to me by a post status member. And so we definitely are listening to the things that you think would be edifying for our community. And if there\'s some, if it\'s something we can move forward with and help facilitate, we were very interested in doing that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we are absolutely open to ideas. The whole idea of together is an us sitting at post status, [00:22:00] handing down all of these events. But certainly doing it together with you. And we want to make sure that we\'re just not guessing what might be good events, but also I\'m listening to you and your needs. And so bring us your ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Fantastic. So again, uh, once again, post-test dot com slash offense. And if you want the, like Michelle said, reach out to us with some of your ideas, uh, best way to do that is just to reach out to us via our contact, um, form. Well share let\'s let\'s just get this on the record. What are the ways people can reach out to, to, to learn more or to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Yep. So I\'m on Twitter at, @michelleames or you can, I also could, uh, can get into the, @post_status so you can message us either place there. If you are on slack, you can find me on the post status lack. I I\'m very easy to find and I\'m, I guess, ubiquitous I\'m everywhere</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> right now. Follow the rainbow of smiles and you will find it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'ll find Michelle. Michelle is probably one of the best people. Um, but that [00:23:00] doesn\'t, that I don\'t owe money to. She\'s a great focal point. So I encourage you. If you have some feedback on the stuff that we were talking about or something new or need that you see in the WordPress community. I mean, we\'re not the eye of Sauron here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can\'t see everything. I\'m not even sure if that\'s the correct reference. I got to go through,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> go back to the books, had the word</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> that\'s good. So thank you very much, Michelle, for covering all of this and, um, getting the word out about this and I\'m looking forward to. One of your first, um, Wednesday Twitter spaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to all the addition to all the other things we\'ve been talking about here. So thanks again. Super excited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> It\'s my pleasure.

It\'s out of his control. Up next is Amber</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amber Hinds:</strong> I\'m Amber Hinds. I\'m the founder of equalize digital, which is an accessibility company. And I also organize the WordPress accessibility meetup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Our next panelist, wasn\'t able to meet with us in person, but the panel lie, but she be prerecorded her introduction and her news picks Winstina Hughes, please introduce yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina:</strong> Hi. I\'m Winstina Hughes. I\'m a core contributor and the community contributor. You know, me as part of the WordPress nearest to the meetup community, I\'m to be an organizer that works with the Maryland department of transportation state highway administration. I started as an assistant regional planner, and I\'m currently working as a customer in government relations manager.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> after her</p>\n\n\n\n<p>comes the almighty Nathan,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nathan:</strong> um Nathan Wrigley from the web builds podcast and the WP Tavern jukebox podcast,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> which means he\'s a better, more professional speaker slash podcaster than me, ladies and gentlemen finally is your Yvette.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yvette:</strong> Thank you. Oh my all those podcasts, we\'ve had some failed. I work as a team lead community for Yoast, pretty active in the WordPress community, but speaking and in the marketing team and very excited to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Just had some news yesterday about, um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yvette:</strong> Shopify</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I was going to say Spotify. Um, I\'m not even going to edit this out. I\'m not even good at this out. I talked to taco yesterday. I said, congratulations on Spotify. And he says, everybody does that for the first month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yvette:</strong> I do it all the time too. So don\'t worry about it. And other than that,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> all right, so let\'s get things started here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\'re here to share our favorite or the biggest, most influential news stories of 2021 related to WordPress that meant the most to us. And if you are new to this concept at listener, we are going to link in the show notes for the first edition. We did have this a couple of weeks ago. There was no need to listen to that episode first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is brand new people with probably a lot of interesting picks. The order has been selected by random.org, Tammie, your first, what is your first news pick for us?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> Oh, my first one is going to be the pattern directory and that\'s the launch of it. So the first bit of it, um, existing, I guess, uh, there, there was a post when it was stolen on the make matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was kind of like- it had kind of been happening. We could be an adding to it. And over the year more of that\'s happened. I wanted to kind of put a focus on that because it\'s something more relatable to pretty much use it, then blocks it. And it shown that you can really rapidly build a patterns and from, and maybe I\'m slipping into the default theme with patterns, but honestly it feels like a theme that\'s kind of running here, but I go that the panel directory is a great news story to kind of start us off</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> And you may have said so-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> April, April was the sort of things were happening before, but there was a post on the 28th of April on make matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> So it was April and man, it seems like we\'ve been talking about this for a long time. We\'re recording this in 2022 also is not helping much, even if it\'s the 5th of January, anytime there\'s a new directory and let\'s be honest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What other new directories as WordPress had. I mean, even the concept of a new directory blows a lot of people\'s minds because I can\'t remember when the theme and plugin directories came into being, but it\'s kinda like, yeah, it\'s been a</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> while. And I mean, this is the 2022 news, but now it\'s opening up the patent actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it\'s a whole year span, pretty much from existing to having submission to now being open up for people to start adding. Um, but it\'s just really exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> All right. Well, good, good, good. Will anybody who had that scratch that off your list. Good. Good job. Good first pick there, Tammie. Thank you very much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Malcolm, you\'re up next? What is your, um, first round pick?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malcolm Perotti:</strong> My first round pick is actually going to be the gravity forums. 2.5 update that happened in April as well of 2021. That overhauled UI, uh, changed how I use gravity forms that helped a lot of people kind of, um, use gravity forms more efficiently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, it had a focus on accessibility. I mean, I don\'t, from my perspective, I don\'t know how much the accessibility changes really help people. For me like gravity forms is like one of the first plugins I install in pretty much every WordPress install, this, this UI update just made it so much easier to lay out pretty forms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It made it so much easier just to interact with it. It made it feel more like, you know, day-to-day WordPress. And I think it was one of the most impactful changes that they could have made. And, uh, because it\'s the plugin, my go-to plugin for collecting user data for like anything. Um, it was just kind of a really important thing for me and the users and clients that we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that, that huge overhaul that they did for gravity forms, 2.5, um, would be my top story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> That was the first commercial plug-in I ever purchased, uh, or I had a license for. And that was you\'re talking like maybe 12, 13 years ago maybe. And their design was definitely the most radical that I\'ve seen throughout it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think they obviously went for a more block based approach, but it really was. All that different to me. So have you been using gravity forms for awhile? It wasn\'t too radical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malcolm Perotti:</strong> Yeah. And I think the, the big advantage that it gave you as the ability to start really, truly laying out your forms, um, the original format or from version 2.4 and below was really about like a, um, vertical structure form where you could kind of do a little bit more horizontal stuff and put things next to each other and split the form in half and kind of do a little bit more design-related stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think one of the things that has always held people back from using gravity forms, especially over the last year or two as other competitors have really moved very well in that space is the design aspect of the forms. And so to see them start taking that a little bit more seriously was, was a good change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> So</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nathan:</strong> is that, is that</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> allowed? Oh yeah, this is a discussion. Oh, okay. I\'ll privately shame you in zoom, zoom chat, but otherwise,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Don Malcolm, do you, do you feel that they were kind of behind the curve a little bit? Do you think their update came a couple of years too</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malcolm Perotti:</strong> late? For sure. I think that, you know, in terms of the ability to, as a developer to work with gravity forms, they\'ve always been kind of ahead of the curve there, in my perspective, their hooks and, and things like that have been very generous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And how much control you have the ability to build your own? Add-ons very easily was always very, um, powerful. but in terms of the, the design language of forums and the control of forums, I think they kind of leaned too much on their community to kind of fill that gap and it let them kind of near right lag behind a lot of other competitors in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I still to this day feel that they\'re a little bit behind some of their other competitors in the. Um, true design control and you still kind of have to use some third-party ad-ons to really do really beautify gravity forms without knowing how to develop a code. Um, but I think it\'s come a long way and I look forward to seeing them continue to push that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amber Hinds:</strong> I mean, it\'s nice not to have to explain CSS classes to clients, right. That\'s how you had to do it before. This is how you put things in columns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Uh, speaking of now, Amber, now that you\'ve spoken up, it just so happens. You\'re next? Thank you very much, Malcolm for that one, Amber, what\'s your first round pick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amber Hinds:</strong> Yeah, so I will say that one was not my first round, but it was on my list. So my first round, I think the thing that really got the most attention was, uh ACF asking lifetime users to buy a subscription. I see. It\'s interesting because I am a lifetime. Like, I mean, I bought a lifetime license. I don\'t know what, in 2011, it was long time ago, but.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I also have, and I, and we put it on every website. We built literally every single website, right. So I have more than gotten my money\'s worth. We don\'t really ask for support, but that said like, you know, we can probably pay more. And, and it is interesting too, because a lot of people were getting really upset about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, you know, I think maybe the way they went about it could have been a little better, but having recently entered the, I sell commercial plug-in space myself in the past 12 months. It kinda, you know, for me, I also see it from the business side. And, you know, and also from the side of, well, if they went away, I use this on every website I built now I have to come up with a different tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like it got a lot of one-sided press and maybe not as much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Was it the concept or how they asked or both or neither? I</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amber Hinds:</strong> mean, maybe it was because they didn\'t like during black Friday, which is when people are expecting to not pay for things or they\'re expecting to pay a 50%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Yeah. That\'s kind of like going up to my parents and saying, it\'s like my parents\' anniversary party where I go up to them and says, by the way you owe me 20 bucks, that\'s kind of an awkward conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amber Hinds:</strong> Yeah at Christmas, I think, I think they probably could have done a lot more to communicate why pay, you know, what are the costs of this plugin? How many, and I know we\'ve seen some that in the past, like the support requests on it are exponential, right? And it\'s got a huge free user base that are referring support as well, but maybe outlining some of the numbers on that might have made it more understandable to people, as opposed to just being like, Hey, want to help us out buy a subscription when you\'ve already paid for this thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> When I was thinking about that story and emphasize to me the importance of lifetime subscriptions, um, if you are someone who\'s acquiring another company and I\'m sure thought went into that. Um, in fact there was, there was discussion even before that notice went out about lifetime subscriptions. But with any business that you\'re acquiring that lifetime subscription chunk is obviously something you need to, to pay close attention to. And I think they did, but I think the messaging was probably, like you said, partly mistimed, if you are able to give some additional incentives to people with lifetime subscriptions. Great. If I was starting a new plug-in service today would be one of those very careful decisions you have to make about like, like short-term lifetime subscriptions could be great for your business, but further down the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amber Hinds:</strong> Yeah. I mean, like that was something we decided, right. We were like, all right, let\'s offer lifetime licenses as like a Kickstarter. Right. So we did it for maybe six months. Never going to do it again. It\'s like a small amount. It\'s enough people that it\'s manageable. It brought in extra revenue that we wouldn\'t have had if we didn\'t do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it\'s not, I think for, from a plugin developer standpoint, you can\'t think of that as like. Primary way of selling your product</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> or you do something really evil and you only offer lifetime subscriptions to very, very old people. That\'s the only, that\'s the only way I can see what we\'re working around that, but that would be cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I was just going to interject here and say, this was the, I think for me, this was the only story that kept coming back in the air. I think it, the, the story itself was June, maybe July, something like that, but that it was acquired from Elliot Condon and, uh, went under the stewardship of delicious brains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then, then there was a couple of occasions subsequently where Ernie, I think it was Twitter. Um, the. You might characterize it as a misstep on Twitter, you know, and a poorly thought out phrase, essentially kind of asking, uh, what, what people\'s thoughts would be about the, the restructuring of the pricing model and, and the inevitable storm that that happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then most of the WordPress news from the, for this year just sort of happened and went away. This one happened, went away, came back, went away, came back. And then here we are still talking about this six months later,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina:</strong> it\'s this a maturity, right? We can\'t maybe use such wide terms as like forever and lifetime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have to be a bit more true to what, what things mean, right. Because lifetime\'s a long time and it\'s sort of that kind of trust, you know, additional product has had the same trusses and you don\'t have in physical products, those kinds of perceptions or those things. And we have to kind of change it\'s the growing up of our ecosystem and that kind of changing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it\'s a sign of a positive sign about ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> All right next up is Winstina Hughes, please heal us. Your first round news picks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina:</strong> I cannot believe that y\'all are missing this number one acquisition use melt choice. And how long have you Sandy had been acquired outside of the word prosperity?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All this is talent acquisition, Mel and Helen. I\'m a silent admire. Y\'all know I\'m my own little corner. I want you to know that you will be missed. You are two incredible contributors. Um, Mel, I want to give you prompts for what touches my world really directly. I know that you were part of a 4.8 team, um, core team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the contributions that you were a part of was that widget and dashboard by let\'s, you know, users know about upcoming. So I want you to know that that work that you did, this is really important directly impacts me the stats that you guys gave 30% increase in meetups. Um, that\'s pretty special for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So thank you for that, Helen. You\'re a boss. I just love how full people are. Um, and I, you know, um, just listened to your commitment to Tena, you know, um, you and I spoke really briefly about it. Just really giving them, you know, so much of your, your time, right? And, um, like your, your contribution, um, to building that company and also to making improvements in core is really phenomenal, uh, directly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That you\'ve impacted, um, me and our New York city meetup group, uh, is your being part of that panel of women in 2017, you know, discussing, uh, just the needs of women than the WordPress community are women of WordPress. And so they made up series as a direct result of that panel discussion. And so, you know, thank you for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so to take in the fact that, you know, these like really two incredible sources of talent have been acquired beyond the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Yeah. We don\'t really think a lot about talent sometimes, especially when it leaves the WordPress computer. Although we, we do, I think we clarified a little bit that, um, Mel hasn\'t left WordPress itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Tammie, where did you say she was going?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> I know she just released a post saying that she went to ATF in her review something. Oh, so we can link to that. She did a annual summary and she said where she was going in that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amber Hinds:</strong> Yeah. I mean, 18 S is the digital services for the government in the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So she\'s probably going to do some WordPress there. Maybe not because it\'s not explicitly. I mean, it\'s focuses a lot on accessibility too, which is kind of cool. That\'s probably a footnote right. In the last one, someone mentioned Pippin leaving right after the acquisition of Sandhills. And he\'s like, I\'m not going to do WordPress at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, it is an interesting thing, right? It, it changes the community when people like that leave.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> It does a lot of the original tech players, like the people who started Google, the people who started obviously apple. Um, there are people that started, um, uh, Amazon, all of the big, big people that started those companies are no longer there. They\'ve retired. They moved on. So it\'s almost happening. The same thing in the WordPress space with acquisitions and people retiring or moving onto, uh, Nathan, uh, what is your first round?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nathan:</strong> So my first round pick is the, is the ACF news, but that\'s been stolen from on-demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I\'m going to get it to my, yeah, that\'s right. I\'m going to go to my pick number two, which is open verse the, uh, the fabulous open verse, which you can find at wordpress.org forward slash open verse. If you\'ve not come across this before, it\'s basically CC search, which kind of appears to have lost its way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t really know if that was financial or, uh, bodies on the ground working on it, but it\'s come under the stewardship of wordpress.org and it\'s, um, it\'s a way that you can go and search currently for, well, it says 500 million images, most of which are CC zero. So you\'ll be able to use these images and not worry about having to get a lawyer involved in a couple of months time, because Getty come after you because you\'ve inadvertently put something on your website, which is copyrighted and the, the most exciting thing isn\'t really, for me, that, that exists under the stewardship of wordpress.org. It\'s really how this is going to be integrated in the future with the block editor. Just the idea that hopefully at some point in the future, if you upload something to your media library, that there\'s talk about the fact that you may be able to just tick a box and that the simple ticking of that box will therefore make your media available to everybody in the same way that you can get other people\'s media at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So imagine how many, how many media libraries contain, how many images throughout the WordPress universe. And it must be tens of millions. And if by simply ticking a box, you could make that available for everybody. That would be fabulous. And that as well, we\'ll end up with this, um, talking on a podcast episode with some people that are working on the project, you never know, you might be able to upload your block patterns for, um, various other things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the scope is much bigger. It could be PDFs, it could be images, it could be audio, it could be video, but also the idea that design, uh, templates, so block patterns. And so on that that you could make those freely available is just fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I would love to have a discussion about that. I think it\'s, it\'s nothing that\'s probably going to it\'s we\'re talking like, like a year, long years, long project, there were</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nathan:</strong> several, several years</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> away, but there that I think fits really well into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you listen to Matt state of word, his overall goal is not just about WordPress, but Gutenberg being bigger than WordPress and all of these acquisitions automatic has done through the years about acquiring this piece of open-source. the, You know, this messaging app, this journaling app, tumbler, all of these things, he seems to be collecting one of every type of different corner of the web in and through automatic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause that\'s probably where it probably makes financial Lawyerist sense to probably do that. But, but if you want an open web, which has been really pushed for the past year, I think even as much as the Gutenberg has been pushed, this, this CC, um, this creative comments acquire, uh, I think fits well into that strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\'d love to talk about more about that. I think Nathan, you just, I think I just had a, um, thought explosion in my head, um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina:</strong> talk about democratizing design publishing, but it\'s kind of a democratizing of design and the leveling up and access of design for everybody which were part of the work that is happening with the editor is about, you know, enabling everyone to have a base line of design and the boundary, because if you give too many tools to do that, you\'re setting people up for failure by having, you know, patterns is one of them, but also templates and having, this knowledge that was kind of locked and told and ancient tools and all those kinds of things, it shouldn\'t be, it should be access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. There\'s always going to be a need for craft. And there\'s always going to need to be a need for design systems designer, but there still should be access to that information. And I won\'t have a design sense and I won\'t you think to ask it because I have to experience it. So, you know, it\'s part of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as we try to have coding standards, having design standards before we create as well, I think it\'s so, so important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> It has been removed from the board. And I must say that was a pick that somebody had in our last episode to it. So it was a very, very popular, very bird about nines. Yes. But you, you actually brought a whole new angle to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So thank you for that, Yvette, what do you got for us?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yvette:</strong> One on my list and it hasn\'t the workers, community, uh, announcement that the team was proposing a decision checklist to restart local events, which initially really excited me. And then as the world progresses, whereas I could jump into an event tomorrow or my heart would love to because connecting with the people that I love and that I resonate with and that hanging out with all those brilliant minds can\'t happen soon enough, but safe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now every time something pops up around in-person events I Get excited. And then I won\'t allow myself to get excited because well, safety. Um, but I think the fact that the checklist is there to help prepare events safely is really a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amber Hinds:</strong> I think it was hard after state of the word. Like I was like, oh, Hey, there, there is a first example of an in-person event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was small. And then I heard like a bunch of people got COVID. Right. So, so that it\'s like,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> and there\'s work camps starting, I think next month, um, in, in the U S and in other locations as well. So yeah, but not to, not to put words in your mouth, but the checklist being the top story for you is getting some order and procedures in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So regardless of when and how these things start, there\'s at least some order to it. Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yvette:</strong> I think it\'s really helpful that they were there and I can wait. Uh, for events to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Normally I would go next, but I already went, I already shared my news is in another episode. So I\'m actually sharing now a real quick one here from, I\'m going to say, I\'m going to Butch, sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I butcher your name LA lax. It\'s Lax Mariappan. And he\'s going to tell us from our zip message, what his new story picked for 2021 was,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lax Mariappan:</strong> um, I\'m lax. I\'m a backend engineer at WebDevStudios. Uh, for me personally, I like themed dot Jason or like the full site editing experience. Uh, it\'s kind of a game changer, but I would say, uh, as I started in 2010 and where you have to, uh, create templates and other stuff, you know, you know, it takes time to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it\'s all in a single file. Great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Well, short and sweet and I love that. So if you had themed Jason, the introduction of which on your list, feel free to remove that. It\'s something that\'s. It\'s still kind of developing, but if you can create customizers, people are creating customizers in the web like web forms to be able to customize your theme dot Jason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I\'ll put a link to the introduction of theme, dive Jason from the wordpress.org associated with that pick into, into the show notes for that good pick Lex. Thank you, lacks. I should say thank you very much, Tammie. You are up. We\'re going to, we\'re doing a second round here, which is second news pick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina:</strong> I am going to tangent on to that, looking at the theme Jason horizon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so Makiah slowed the pace back in August about the ingest of horizon and this isn\'t necessarily a news post. This is a thought post. And I kind of think it\'s really interesting to balance in these posts posts because, um, those are how we kind of start thinking about things a little bit. And this post really was about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The now and the future of theme, Jason. Um, so theme Jason was a previous year this year and the future year thing. It spanned multiple years really. Um, and in that it really dare to dream about thinking about design structure and portability and thinking about native apps and how it could even control ads, maybe in the future events super-wide in this post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think it\'s really interesting to start thinking about, um, there was a term used in it about coded recipe if they have a site looks and feels. And I think starting to not just think of like this little bit of script, which is what we\'re kind of focusing on with the, and Jason, but as a mechanism of where it could become how it can ease things like accessibility, just make design more accessible to everybody to understand, and then bring in kind of apps and maybe even a more medical admin space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it\'s, it\'s one of one. Bloodsport pieces, I guess, too. It\'s one of those posts that I think sometimes we have all these, like opposition is on the stupid side and stuff, and sometimes posts like this kind of like really quietly. Um, and I think it\'s really important to kind of go back to them and kind of digest them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s about that. That was back in August. And it\'s a post I\'ve gone back to a few times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Yeah. The sheer readability of dot Jason and its flexibility as loud already. Like I mentioned before, a couple of people creating tools for its customization. That\'s the kind of innovation maybe it\'s been because of the last couple of years, for me personally, about listening to people, discuss how difficult it is to customize blocks without, and then, you know, ACF and PHP and all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you know, in the beginning, you know, you know, you have to learn react. You have to learn this in order to do the two blocks and so forth. There was, there was definitely a learning curve there and there still is. And there\'s other tools that are helping with that, but just the theme, Jason, right off the bat is human readable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina:</strong> Yeah. I said it needs to be things, but it\'s also the mechanism and what it for tolls. And I think that\'s the interesting part about this post and the interesting kind of change. Like we\'ve, we\'ve got the mechanisms and now are they, where can that go and start into that\'s something like damning to dream.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I, that\'s kind of what I liked about one candidate for, to dream about the, what ifs in it as well. So yeah, I think that that is something we should do more of. So for me, it was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> And before I dare to dream, I\'m going to first next dare to ask Malcolm what his second round draft newspaper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malcolm Perotti:</strong> Yes. So my second round is actually going to be a story from way back in January of 2021. And basically I want to put it under the umbrella umbrella of like good WordPress search gets harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so elasticpress.io, um, was trying to figure out what the heck they were going to do next. After the elastic search project abandoned their open source licensing in, in the general sense of WordPress search is not talked about much other than to say. Basic built-in WordPress search kinda sucks. Um, and this was an opportunity to kind of improve that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now there\'s been some step backs away from that due to, you know, some licensing issues. Um, you know, there\'s, uh, open search, which is a fork of elastic search and there\'s a lot of different things kind of happening in that space. Um, I really think that the elastic press service from TenUp is, is a great, easy kind of entry point for a lot of people to get good search on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and I\'ll be interested to see kind of how they deal with these continuing issues. I don\'t know that they\'ve announced any change yet. I think the conversation was maybe that they would use open search instead of elastic search, um, for elastic press. And I don\'t know if that means they\'ll change it to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open press.io instead of elastic press that AOR or however they\'re going to deal with that, that kind of issue. But, um, I think that, you know, as a WordPress community, we still need to kind of fight for better search in WordPress. Um, it\'s one of the two main issues that I see in WordPress currently agree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s what we do. Right. We drop back to Google, which is not ideal, well,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> that\'s not the open web that, um, yeah, I think if performance, wasn\'t such a distracting factor in terms of WordPress, in terms of like teams to put together, I\'d love to put a search team together. Performance effects, all WordPress sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Search is huge, but it doesn\'t affect everybody right now, I guess, because not everybody searches through a site, but they just had an article. Um, I earlier this year about how young people, these days don\'t know what a file or folder system. I don\'t I\'ll have I\'ll share the link. I don\'t have time to explain it now because</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amber Hinds:</strong> I don\'t have any frame of reference because vanilla folder stuck in a</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> drawer, but what do they know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what do they know search, right. But what if there was like a little, uh, there\'s a, plug-in like this that already kind of exists where you hit a key command on, on your WordPress site. And like a little window shows up, like on a Mac that you have the, um, Alfred or something, and you can type in a few words, but it\'s not the UI that it\'s the, it\'s the effectiveness of the search built in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So I think Malcolm knew regardless, and I think, uh, please feel free to include any, uh, extra link in there for some of the things that you mentioned. If, if it\'s not covered. I definitely think search has been one of those long time neglected. Oh, I\'ll just use something else to get by and search WP, which by the way is also an awesome thing as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it\'s kind of a slightly, it\'s a slightly different tool. Um, I think, but built in better built in WordPress or. Whatever can get us there or thinking more about it, I think is fantastic. So Malcolm hats off to you, because I didn\'t even think about that until now. Shame on me. Must be the coffee talk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s the coffee talking. Speaking of coffee, talking, Amber, what is your second round pick? My coffee wants to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amber Hinds:</strong> So my second round pick, I don\'t think got a ton of traction in WordPress, but it has huge implications for all websites, WordPress websites. Um, and that was, um, the eyebobs versus Murphy settlement, which was a lawsuit against a website that used the accessibility accessibility overlay, and they had it already and they got sued.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then. Karl groves who was of tenon and is now of level access. People may have heard of him because he did a lot of the initial accessibility audits for Gutenberg. And he actually was an expert witness in that case. And the, the whole, I mean, it\'s fascinating. I\'ll give you a link to the PDF of the case because there\'s a 50 page attachment that talks about how.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excessively actually adds accessibility problems to websites. And so that was the original piece, which was, they got sued even though they had it. But this year, the big news that really went around the accessibility community was that they settled, they removed the overlay. And as part of the settlement agreement, they agreed that they had to make their, um, excessive, their website accessible the real way, not using an overlay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that really. I wish it had gotten more traction in the WordPress space or with web developers or designers. Um, you know, it\'s harder for small businesses, but I feel like even a lot of web developers don\'t pay enough attention to this. And, and a lot of them are kind of just being like, oh, I just put an overlay on the site, you know, excessively or, uh, what is it a user way is a really big one in WordPress that probably, I think that one has the most active installed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and, and this case was pretty much like that will not help your clients. They will get sued. You might get sued too. So for me, that was a huge one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yvette:</strong> To accessibility experts from the Netherlands actually wrote quite a really good article about that. And you sniped me with the story, but it would be nice maybe to include the link in, in what you were saying, because I think it\'s yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, accessibility. It\'s just so, so important. And the overlays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Don\'t do don\'t do shortcuts like that bad idea. Um, Winstina you\'re up, give us your second newspaper, please.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina:</strong> My second job pick comes from the post status extra archives, number 37. And, uh, I am pulling from it, Mary job\'s suggestion that we have a WordCamp Africa. I love it. I love the idea of having a word camp Africa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, this is a reflection of my, my African pride. I am I\'m west African, and so is Mary Job and, and they think that there is definitely an African massive within the WordPress community. And this massive has so much to offer. And you know, this massive, you know, is, is, has like a large diaspora, um, and let\'s put together work camp Africa we have, who were in camp US.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which I wrap heart. Um, we have a WordCamp, Europe. We have a WordCamp Asia. Um, it\'s time, it\'s time for WordCamp Africa. You, um, have a lead organized already. Mary\'s stepped up and said that this is something that she wants. And, I think that we definitely have the resources and we have the capacity to make it happen, whether or not this is a combination of remote, um, you know, having something that\'s online and also in person, maybe it\'s an online word camp and then like an in-person, contributor day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t know. Um, I don\'t know the logistics of it. I\'m in the U S I\'m not part of the west African, um, community, uh, you know, that\'s, that\'s on the continent. I can\'t speak to what the needs are. I can only advocate for, for us and say, you know, it\'s, it\'s time, it\'s time where.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Put that on. I was going to say bumper sticker, but that doesn\'t, that doesn\'t even cover it. That should be, it should be a full-fledged t-shirt and clothing line. I\'m actually going to point for her pick. I\'m going to point to the news link for the post status episode. She\'s actually referring to, to summarize that as best I can, from that conversation with Mary, there is such an explosion of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things that are happening in Africa right now, dealing with WordPress and the communities, and they\'re doing a fair share of it on their own. And I, and I don\'t know if that was the, it\'s the best way to describe it, but they\'ve started, I think WP, africa.org, they are running with these various kinds of meetups, I think 10 years ago where the WordPress community was in the America and Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'re, you know, they\'re, they\'re kind of running their own show. They don\'t really have a, they only have a few WordCamps now in Africa, but they don\'t have anything globally yet tied together. And I think now that they\'re starting to get the kind of, kind of getting that mass, that mass point where they could have some sort of, you know, continental type of movement they\'re, um, they\'re, they\'re becoming more and more unified in their networks and structures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think that\'s a excellent link, new suggestion for just making sure that we\'re aware of all of the continents and spaces on the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amber Hinds:</strong> Well, I think too, what comes in with that is like, is there a possibility for having more. WordCamps or talks that end up on wordpress.tv that are not in English, because I really feel like that would make a huge difference in allowing more people access to learning WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, you know, I don\'t know if it\'s all of Africa, maybe it is going to be an English word camp. Maybe don\'t, I don\'t know. Maybe we\'ll be French, but, um, like that is an interesting thought, like, could there be a lot of different languages that come out of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> So, yeah, we\'ll see. I mean, obviously COVID is putting some stints in the plans Africa right now is obviously not doing very well with, COVID just like other parts of the world as well, but I think we should just pay more attention, pay more attention to places other than the us and Europe, sometimes a lot of other stuff happening in the rest of the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you haven\'t checked out. My discussion with Mary and the, or at least the links in the show notes for that episode, please feel free to do so. All right, good pick, uh, Nathan, uh, what I, what\'s your number two,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nathan:</strong> my number two really doesn\'t have a URL associated with it, but, um, it is the fact that we are still as a community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hanging in there had a couple of years where yeah, but what, what I\'m meaning is, you know, this could literally have fallen to pieces over the last couple of years. You know, we relied a great deal on in-person events. We have gone through an awful lot and yet I see people all over the place. Making incredible commitments to making sure that we\'re still able to do things like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here we are. And David, thank you. There\'s six of us on the screen at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I\'m thinking don\'t thank me. I\'m just trying to get away from my family,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nathan:</strong> but I\'m thinking of events. One that Springs to mind, uh, is WordFest, uh, an event which is completely free to attend, um, has built a platform to make that event possible, um, loads and loads of people volunteering to, to be involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that really is, is on what I\'m talking about it\'s the sort of the maturation of the community, the maturation of online events, the fact that we\'ve managed to keep going, we\'re patting ourselves on the back. We, we were hoping for events to come around next year, going back to the vet\'s point from the first round.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe that\'s not going to happen, but for reasons that I can\'t quite explain, we\'re still managing to hang in there and on the whole, we\'re not falling out with each other and. Mirror that across different industries and just see how that falls out. And my prediction is it won\'t be quite as rosy as our little community has been.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina:</strong> Okay. And my press one, I think we\'re adapting to be more robust. So I think in the future, remembering that some people won\'t be able to travel. Some people aren\'t ever going to want a chapel that some people have changed and people have adapted deadlines and that\'s totally cool. And the spec in that going forward, maybe we rely too much on impassive, maybe relied too much on different things and finding these new kids so healthy and it sets us up for stronger and it makes us more global and it helps us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be more inclusive if we want to have longevity and we want the habits, it\'s part of that doing it. It\'s hard to do, right? Because they are easier. Wasn\'t easier getting on planes and doing things. It just felt easier because it was what we may be new. But yeah, it\'s super exciting to see how we can be more inclusive in different ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yvette:</strong> So many of our people, people of our community have relied on each other to get through these periods where, um, not everyone in your physical circles was. Comfy with zoom and, and all the tools that we use that we already use to connect. So we had, uh, I\'ve, I\'ve been part of a group that played, um, uh, Dungeons and dragons, sir, for a year, like every other, every two, three weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just to have that moment where you\'re not just among your family or on the phone with other family and friends and do something entirely different. And for me personally, I think for the other people in that group too, it made such a difference. Um, not falling out, like you say, Nathan, and, uh, even strengthening friendships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah. I think really, I was just trying to congratulate us as a whole on. You know, if anybody put on an event, if anybody contributed anything or committed anything, anybody showed up and gave 20 minutes here, there, and everywhere to make a thing happen that wouldn\'t have otherwise happened. Uh, all of these little paper cots add up to a great big injury, what a terrible analogy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you get the point. Yeah. But you get the point, you know, lots and lots of little things happening largely in, in many cases on, on song, on accounted for, you know, if it\'ll probably never be acknowledged and written about in blog posts or on podcasts, but people hanging in keeping the community together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I, for one totally rely on it now, you know, it\'s like it is an extended family and it means a lot to me. And I\'m glad that everybody\'s hanging on in there with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amber Hinds:</strong> The zoom meet ups, I would tend to in the past, like two years, I\'ve attended all these WordPress meetup. Across the U S and Canada, like once I would never go to, and I\'ve gotten to hear other people talk that I would never normally hear speak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and I\'ve been able to speak at some that I would, you know, like you, you\'re not going to fly somewhere to speak out a WordPress meetup. Right. Uh, and, and I just feel like I\'ve actually strengthened some of my connections with people because of all of the four switch to digital that we maybe didn\'t have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, it\'s a bummer local meetup. We\'re not doing the zoom stuff. Cause it feels too hard. But, uh, but there are definitely a lot that are, and I think that\'s, it\'s, it\'s been nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina:</strong> I know, I would add that. I think it\'s, there\'s a personal choice there as well, which I think is really nice. So I\'ve probably done less meat-ups, but that\'s also a personal choice, which I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have that now. And we have the more options that people can do. And I guess that\'s kind of an, I am so grateful for all the people, giving all the options for those of us that maybe didn\'t have the bandwidth for different people have had to do different things during this time. And different people are going to do different things as a process during this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is a time which wasn\'t just the time that you experienced it, it\'s the time that you processed after it because we\'re all humans and you need to do that. Right. Um, so we\'re going to need to sit so that I even need to take the burden for the people that have the Baton and did all this sauce and stuff for me, you know, that\'s that\'s community by picking up something and taking it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and I knew I could stay connected with the community, but I could step back and I could do that because my community was there. Being informed by things that post status and other things. And I could do my creative thing, but that had that information that we didn\'t have a few years ago. We didn\'t have that kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn\'t need to attend things. Um, so it\'s just been able to like turn the volume up or down as you need to still remain connected with the community, but still feel a sense of belonging and still having people check on you. It\'s beautiful. Plus one with the beauty and the heart and the group\'s hugs, but just the choice having career option choices and personal choices in how you do your path in this community is, is a huge part of this now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> All right. Speaking of love, let\'s give some love to you vet. Uh, what is your second round pick here? My second</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yvette:</strong> one has to do with, uh, with the growth rate of WordPress, and the fact that that\'s actually slowing down and while we\'re so like humongous in the CMS space. Um, we\'re not growing as fast as we used to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, part of that has to do with the growth of e-commerce because COVID forced everyone to move to online, shopping, maybe a bit faster than they were comfortable with. Um, but it\'s also something that we do need to be aware of. And as some people already have been warning us for, for more than a year, we are losing terrain when it comes to organic traffic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, for people\'s searching for things like starting a website, uh, starting a web shop. Um, and there is talk about this. Um, but I think it needs more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> There is going to be discussion more discussion. I think this year about what market share really means. I think we\'ve been looking at the percentage numbers and by the way, the, those percentage numbers are, might be going away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We might not have that statistic by mid-year because Alexa, not that Alexa, the other Alexa, Alexa, that\'s been twice. Yes. I know if I say it a third time, she comes through the window or the mirror. Um, but, but that, that, that, um, way of getting in that market share that 43% where it is right now. That\'s no longer going to be a source for w three texts, um, coming to, so I think going along with your point and again, feel free to link the provost appropriate news article to that, um, market share slowing down, but in overall, like what market share should we be paying attention to what statute we paying attention to?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think your pick fits perfectly along with that, you\'re fixated on one number. What happens regardless of how legitimate the number is, what happens when that. Stop slow us down. What does it do? I mean, if it, if it\'s, if it\'s my blood pressure, then that\'s great. But when it comes to WordPress market share maybe, maybe not so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yvette:</strong> I know among the WordPress marketing team, I mean, this is a team that has been growing with ups and downs and all sorts of twists and twirls. Um, but years ago we already asked for things like KPIs and growth and access to analytics, um, And we\'re really happy that we have some more sponsor contributors on our team now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So hopefully this will also spark that fire of where do we want to go? What do our target audiences look like? Um, how do we really convert them from hearing about word press when you\'re doing that first research about, um, getting a website up and running to how flexible is this and how am I going to get locked in with, with this or with closed source, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s so I, one of my pet peeves is teaching this new selling, and that really, uh, is something that we could be better at, within the WordPress community. Um, like entry-level content for people that doing that first research winter building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Absolutely. Wow. That was a great two rounds. I love the fact that we\'ve got so many different perspectives here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what we\'re going to go through next for the next, maybe 10 minutes is like a, you\'re going to go through the rest of your picks that you brought with you. And if you may feel free to mention a snipe, just briefly mentioned the pic. Um, you don\'t have to go into detail. In fact, we don\'t have the time to go into details on them, but before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I\'m going to give you a minute to kind of look over the rest of your list and decide what to share as we go through one last time. While I do that, though, I\'m going to play responses, things that the community has been sharing, but I just felt like we should share at least one, one is from Mr. Strebel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Strebel:</strong> I think the biggest story of 2021 in WordPress was Jason St. Anne\'s full site editing post. That was a meat and potatoes deep dive into the current state of the editor, which as it continues to evolve will be the experience for tens and tens of millions of site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that got my most, the most attention out of me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\'m a little bias. Pepsi was mentioned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Well, it, it\'s not a struggle video without a Pagely mention. So check that box, but I think I, I can\'t help, but think that\'s a good post to have when you\'re viewing, when you need some good absorption on the subject. So kudos to struggle for that. Let me share with you mats real quick here member Doris had said, well, it\'s Matt from our report media and the WP minute.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Medeiros:</strong> I think the biggest story,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I just want to say, just look how you people are listening to this all linked to this and listen, listening just looks so professional. Usually has that jacket on that makes him look like he\'s recording from Antarctica. Like if you ever seen him like that, if not, I\'ll share it with you later, but I just wanted to say a map before we even hear you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great professional job, sending us your, a video here. Here we go</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Medeiros:</strong> from airport media and the WP minute.com. I think the biggest story of 2021 are all of the new faces in the WordPress community. Showing up on my timeline. I\'m hearing them in podcasts. I\'m seeing them on YouTube and it\'s fantastic to see a whole new cohort of people supporting the community and bringing in fresh ideas and fresh perspectives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I applaud everyone really stepping it up, uh, in WordPress as my number one news item for 2021. And Hey, by the way, David Short form community contributed content. This is a fantastic. Idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Okay. A compliment will not get past the point that you didn\'t give a specific news item mat. So, you know, minus one point for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do will have to acknowledge that. Um, and this may be Tyson to Nathan\'s a bit, a little bit. We are, we\'re surviving together as a community and still taking in new people. We\'re seeing, we\'re definitely seeing new people present their voices. Here\'s one more from, um, Mr. Bob, Don here. Hey</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Bob, Do The Woo. So I think that\'s a big news. You\'re here. I\'m here. Yes, we it\'s almost the end of the year. We\'ll be here in 2022. So daycare B-cell man,ource. This is WordPress. I mean any open source community and the tool has its ups and downs. And Hey, I\'d say there\'s a lot more ups than downs and Hey&#8230; yeah, I\'ve talked to new people. I\'ve talked to people who\'ve been in space.I love seeing who is out there and who is doing with WordPress. So I think that\'s a big news. You\'re here. I\'m here. Yes, we it\'s almost the end of the year. We\'ll be here in 2022. So take care be well man.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I think, I think it\'s because it\'s just, you know, year two, a pandemic, everybody\'s kind of just thankful that we\'re all here together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right? We actually have two more videos. One from Michelle Fran yet,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> For me the biggest WordPress news story of this year was acquisitions, but it was specifically the acquisition of give WP into liquid web because it affected me personally. I was the director of customer success that give WP at the time and give WP joined the liquid web family and was under, became under the umbrella of our software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is stellar WP. I was the director of customer success, forgive, and I am the director of community engagement</p>\n\n\n\n<p>for stellar WP. I get to do lots of fun things with that, including the</p>\n\n\n\n<p>work that I do at post status, um, and being on the team, they\'re contributing in many ways</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and, uh, what I do in big orange heart, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that was pretty big news for me. And it opened up a whole new world of possibilities and allowed me to do many things like attending the state of the word. So, yeah, that\'s what I would say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> And we have a video here from Rob Carnes</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rob Carnes:</strong> Everybody Rob Carnes here. I wanted to talk about what I thought was the most important word, press story the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think it will shock a lot of people, but it won\'t, and that\'s our community. Our community has had a really rough go with this year between Gutenberg, mergers and acquisitions. And the fractioning in our community to do the other issues, or do you usual wordpress.com versus where press.org and depending on who you talk to, the belief that automatic cause doing the right thing or wrong thing, I think we have a lot of work to do within our own community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think this is the whole future of WordPress and there\'s the whole future of open source. And it\'s why it\'s the number one issue we face today. And that\'s the problems in our own community. And it seems the issue has never changed and nobody ever looks at the people causing the issues instead of realizing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That we need to keep building the community. And one of those reasons, and it\'s been hard to do without word camps in the pandemic is to keep building our online communities towards our door on Twitter, with Iran, Facebook, whether it\'s the new WordPress product community I\'m involved with in LinkedIn, we need to keep building those communities and we need to work really hard at it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is the biggest story. And that\'s the future of WordPress. To some degree. I do agree that there is some disagreement in the WordPress community. I don\'t think it\'s something we haven\'t faced in the past, though. If you are interested in the WordPress community, there is an excellent episode, upcoming of post status excerpt, where I talked to Bob Dunn about the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I suggest you check out. Like I promised let\'s bring out quickly are the picks that we didn\'t get a chance to share. Nathan, since you have to step out real quick, let\'s take you first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I want to mention, now this, this project may have been going for a little while, but I\'m just really impressed with a particular individual and a community that has grown up around a product that he\'s released.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it\'s a page builder actually, and it\'s called bricks. I don\'t know if you\'ve come across this page builder in the past, but it seems to be gaining a lot of attention. You can find it at bricks, builder.io. I confess I have not really used it, but I\'ve kind of been looking in their group and I\'m just extraordinarily amazed at what this guy Thomas has been able to pull off seemingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All by himself in the space of, well, I\'m going to say it\'s about 18 months, but really kind of came around the beginning portion of last year and, um, and in their community and in various other communities that there\'s always the contrast. There\'s always the people drawing the contrast between the, the, the pace of change on the WordPress Gutenberg side and the fact that people an individual in this case, or a small team in the case of other page builders can manage to pivot and iterate so very, very quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I just wanted to give a shout out to Thomas for all the work that he\'s doing. He\'s managed to gather himself a nice sizeable Facebook group of devoted followers. So just kudos to</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> him. Well, good. That\'s another thing I can look forward to exploring, cause I haven\'t had a chance to, to explore that yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Um, so Tammie, what\'s what, uh, real quick here, what is anything left in your truck? Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> I have two things. One is the release, uh, Alibaba from, uh, announced the release of eight either. I am O uh, theme. Um, I, it\'s an amazing theme, um, that lots of started blood-based themes and happening, but this one was really pivotal for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is kind of was in August. It was very all the way through, uh, it\'s got incredible paddle library and also commerce support. And I think that that is kind of essential kind of things. Approach is really one of that systematic approach to design and is a combination. So I think the work that is happening with her and her partner in the studio is really, really crucial for this space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the other one is, um, experimentations, I mean, excited about genuinely people experimenting. Um, and how did a. Kind of presentation about that for us. And then he posted that on his blog, his presentation, um, about how by experimenting, using existing features and pushing the boundaries of them. So he did it with block styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, we start to know the boundaries, but also what could become. So I think that that shows that, you know, um, we only get to know really where we\'re going to go as a project that starting to experiment. And we only get to know how to use these things by experimenting. So those are the two picks that no one picked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I\'m kind of excited that no one picked my pigs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> That\'s that\'s a good thing. It shows you\'re you\'re you\'ve you been a worthy, worthy adversary? Um, Malcolm what\'s quickly. What\'s your anything?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malcolm Perotti:</strong> Yeah. So I was interested in talking about the whole delicious sprains ACF thing, but that we kind of covered that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, the other two things that I had was the GoDaddy plain text password issue. I think it kind of, you know, we have to really continue to think about security, not just in WordPress, but the partners that we use to, um, you know, manage and grow our sites. And then the other thing that I wanted to talk about was, uh, you know, on WP mainline, Jeff posted about his issue with trying to transform two paragraph blocks in an ordered list into a quote block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I think we need to continue to work on Gutenberg and those, those abilities that we had, um, before with the editor to be able to kind of have that publishing experience be just as good or better with the block editor. I think there\'s still these edge cases that are missing that support. So those, the only ones I had left</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Jeff seems to hit a lot of those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it\'d be, he needs to continue writing. Yeah, let\'s see. Um, Amber what\'s. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amber Hinds:</strong> So that was a great segway into classic editor support continues for at least a year block editor, Ben wagon pretty early. I mean, we did it from the beginning. We still have some clients, especially like universities or government, like things that really need a lot of control that are like, they are classic editor all the way, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, so I think that\'s a big deal that that\'s continuing. And I know they said for a year, I\'m certain that we\'ll get another year extension next year. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> the other thing kind of like my taxes, but yes,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amber Hinds:</strong> the other thing that kinda stood out for me this year was the weird Wix versus WordPress battle,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With sending everyone the headphones and Matt writing a pretty. Snarky dab, field blog posts at them. And you know, it\'s, it\'s weird. Cause it is, it is an interesting, like, okay, we are a competitor, right. Obviously massively competitor, but at the same time for me, I\'m a little bit like. Okay, this feels childish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s all just move on. Like, what does this say about us? You know, so</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I agree. And then Matt mentioned them at the state of the word and that kind of just fell apart</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amber Hinds:</strong> very intentionally. Right. And I, and I like some of them, I was just like, okay, come</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> on. No, but, but no, I forgot about that marketing campaign, the weirdest marketing campaign, guerrilla style.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you had the ads with the, with the weird people in the ads, or at least it was weird to me. So it\'s the headphones. It was the weird ad campaign. And then there was the public back and forth. So that\'s yeah. Let\'s yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amber Hinds:</strong> The footnote on that ad campaign too was it\'s it was a little bit interesting to see who Wix thought was a WordPress influencer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were some people that were like, okay. Yes, of course it makes sense that they would, and then there were other people that were like weird. I got, I had friends from Wix and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Some people got, and I bet you some people\'s feelings got hurt when they didn\'t get their headphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m sorry. I had something in my phone, but okay. Yes. Great. Never forget a Wix 2021. Never forget. Um, that I think this is we\'re down to you now. Is there anything quickly you want to just touch base before we close out here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yvette:</strong> Absolutely. I had some broad match, uh, topics on my list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Keep it short, keep it short because I got eventually feed my kids.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yvette:</strong> I will totally do that. Uh, one was an article, uh, about an open source license that requires you to do no harm. And while that\'s probably not tying in with GPL, really just like that, I thought it brought up some philosophical things about good versus bad and inclusive versus protecting your community from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eagles influences evil being a little bit too strong of a word, but you\'re probably get the</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Evil spirits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yvette:</strong> Um, yeah, so I thought I was really interesting and maybe something for conversations down the road, what do we want, what do we not want within our community? Then there was an article about how people who could not attend group therapy physically really turned to open, uh, to, to online, uh, platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that made me feel really thankful for the fact that we basically have her own mental health blood from inner community where people can connect with people that they\'re already have some things in common with, which makes building those friendships and helping each other out really, really, um, so much easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and there\'s one really not news, but a thread on Twitter that just really worked my heart. And it was Michelle Frechette offering people in anyone basically who tied in to that or asked for it, uh, To create, um, haikus or limericks or a compliment for them. And I think that was just, well, it was really hard to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Wow. That\'s yeah, let\'s not forget too much quote, the technical stuff, but yeah, let\'s not forget to the, uh, the heartwarming stuff too. I wanted to share one last one. Last thing, I think it was from Joe. Hey everybody, Joe. Casabona here from the, how I built it. Podcasts and WP review. And I think the biggest story in WordPress in 2021 was the delay of the release of WordPress 5.9, I think since 5.0, we\'ve seen, uh, seemingly arbitrary deadlines get pushed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when features haven\'t been fully ready. We\'ve seen features get put into release candidates, even though there should be a feature freeze then. And I feel like 5.9 is a turning point where we don\'t push out the release until the core features. The main headline features are ready, and that is good for the development team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it\'s good for the end user, which is ultimately. We\'ve had some things before in previous releases that maybe weren\'t ready or were pushed or something. And we have this thing about deadlines, but, uh, I\'m not sure if this is sends a huge trend because I, because I know that there\'s four releases may be being planned next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we\'re squeezing them in like little sausages, but I\'m sure everything will work out fine. I\'m sure everything is, but this does give you an example of saying, Hey, listen, something wasn\'t ready. And I realized there was a big, we, I have a episode with Anne McCarthy on this. Like everything was spaghetti, like everything was tied to everything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you couldn\'t really, it was very, very difficult to push just a part of the release out. Um, think I\'m going to summarize, I think that\'s a decent way of summarizing that. So I think it was a great idea not to wait and pushing out at the end of January, but it does give you at least some precedent to say, Hey, listen, we pay attention to these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if something needs to be moved, it\'s moved. So that kind of gives you hope for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina:</strong> Uh, so it\'s a Bita inevitably. So it\'s a difference for two reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I wanted to thank everybody here for participating in this. I thought this was a great, um, great diversity. I think we only repeated like maybe one or two news posts from the previous episode, which shows you like how much there happened in 2021, but also a lot of things that I don\'t think I even gave that much consideration to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think when people listen to this podcast, I think they\'re going to be able to appreciate the same things I did so quickly around the table. Let\'s just say farewell and just remind us where we can find you on social it start with Tammie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> Uh, you can find me in common ties and own things and thank you so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I hope everyone has just a calm and the year that they really need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Yes. Yes. I think my coffee\'s kicking in now. So I think, I think I got all that in Malcolm. Um, share with us where we can find you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malcolm Perotti:</strong> Uh, the best place to find me is on Twitter, uh, at find purpose and, uh, always check me out on the WP mainline podcasts at WP mainline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> And thanks for coming Malcolm. I greatly appreciate it. And don\'t forget to rub it in to a Jeff Amber. Thank you for coming. You\'ve been a real joy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amber Hinds:</strong> Oh, thank you for having me. So the best social media for me is on Twitter and I really got to update my handle, but it\'s, uh, at a core blog, which is a U C O E U R blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And otherwise, if it\'s easier, you can just go to equalize digital.com and get to me that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> And I\'m most of you are probably on post status as well. I think, um, at least if, if not shame on you, Nathan, where can we find.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, Nathan and Nathan, I think you\'re muted. Otherwise you\'re there you go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Sorry. Enormous. PhotoPass sorry about that. WP belts.com or on Twitter. It\'s just WP builds</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> and thank you for coming, Nathan. I greatly appreciate it. You probably didn\'t know what you were getting into. And I think this is the first time you and I have talked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for all I know,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nathan:</strong> it\'s very nice to meet you all</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> It could be the last too for if I didn\'t do my job right. Um, and finally, Yvette, it was nice to see your face. And I think this is the first time we\'ve met as well. Can you tell people where to find you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yvette:</strong> Yes.

Great. That\'s awesome. Um, why am I whispering? Thank you Yvette. Very much for that. I greatly appreciate it. I, and I appreciate everyone here. This was meant for the European time zone, but some of you were awesome. You woke up in the morning on an Eastern time zone. Thank you very much for all.

Although unique in their own ways, being generally wide, spacy, and modular instantly make them look like they came from the same mold. This is not to say they&#8217;re bad though… I&#8217;m just not really fond of such design. I prefer something more compact and personal.</p><p>By &#8220;compact and personal,&#8221; I think of something like a small room cramped with all your belongings, photos, postcards, etc., giving it a cozy feeling (Tumblr themes kind of fit this). The block themes I&#8217;ve seen are all just so airy and professional-looking that using them is like taking cautious first steps in a big fancy office, where you&#8217;re afraid of making too much sound.</p><p>What do you think of this design trend in block themes? And do you happen to know of any &#8220;compact and personal&#8221;-looking block themes?</p><cite>Isabel</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I love that description of the type of theme you are looking for. It reminds me of my college years where my roommates and I had our own cramped bedrooms. I would always decorate my walls with drawings and other things I had created. I piled my favorite books on the shelves of an old TV entertainment unit that my grandpa had built. Across the top, I lined trinkets and other keepsakes from adventures I had been on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was my own little paradise, my world in about 120 square feet. If you walked into that room, it would not take long for you to get to know the person behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is what I love about personal websites. They can be like college dorm rooms, giving us a glimpse into the unique personalities behind them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Far too often, it feels like WordPress themers have moved away from the core audience that played at least some part in the platform&#8217;s initial popularity. Today, everything seems to be catered to business, eCommerce, portfolios, and minimalist blogging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To answer your first question, I am a fan of open-canvas designs. The space gives me room to focus on my content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, like you, I am not seeing enough variety. This is not necessarily specific to block themes. You will find similar trends for classic WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that said, the block system does play a part in what designers are creating. We are still in the infancy of block themes. Technically, they are not supported by WordPress yet. However, they will be when version 5.9 launches next week. Many designers will be timid at first, not really pushing the boundaries of what is possible. It is similar to taking that first step in a pool&#8217;s shallow end. You are acquainting yourself with the water, getting a feel for the temp, before you wade farther in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I expect that we will see more variety over the coming months as more theme authors begin learning the new system. I hope that includes more designs like what you are asking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I first read your question, <a href=\"https://lizonka.carrd.co/\">a Carrd site</a> that I have had bookmarked for a while immediately came to mind. I came across it when venturing down the rabbit hole of anime-related fan sites around the web. The design does not fit my personal brand, but I have been fascinated by it for months.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Page from a Carrd site.\n\n\n\n<p>The site screams personal and cozy. It reminds me of some of my early days on the web when every other blog I visited seemed to have its own brand of quirkiness. You can still find a lot of that if you <em>really</em> dive into the various brands of fandom that are out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every now and then, I come back to this site for design inspiration. I envision building something like this on top of WordPress. The community is sorely missing out on the fun side of the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many Carrd sites like the one shown above have a bit of this, but they are not full-blown websites. They are essentially personal landing pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tumblr is the king when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/themes/\">themes with personality</a>. <em>Where else can I possibly consider switching over to a design dedicated to Taylor Swift?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<img />Testing a Taylor Swift theme for my Tumblog.\n\n\n\n<p>You will be hard-pressed to find anything like that in the WordPress theme directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, I only know of one block theme that fits into the compact-and-cozy category, and that is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/kubrick2/\">Kubrick2</a>. I covered it in detail <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/yes-a-block-based-version-of-the-kubrick-wordpress-theme-exists\">last month in a review</a>. It is now live on WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Customizing Kubrick2 from the site editor.\n\n\n\n<p>Kubrick was one of the early default WordPress themes, and Kubrick2 is a recreation of it using blocks. It has that compact layout that seems to fit the description you provided. But, the design is a bit outdated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, it is customizable via the site editor. It is also one of the least complex block themes out there. In mere minutes, you could modify its design with little effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until we see more themes, Kubrick2 is likely your best option.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 00:52:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.9 RC3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12050\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/01/wordpress-5-9-rc3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4710:\"<p>The third <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#rc\">Release Candidate</a> (RC3) for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-9/\">WordPress 5.9</a> is here!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to everyone who has contributed thus far toward testing and filing bugs to help make WordPress 5.9 a great release. <strong>WordPress 5.9 is slated to land in just</strong> <strong>one week—on January 25, 2022.</strong> You still have time to help!

They anticipate it will lessen the need for merchants to seek developer support when scaling their stores. Having orders in custom tables should also allow WooCommerce developers to extend core more easily, as well as create and restore data backups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WooCommerce development team is <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/projects/8\">tracking the project on GitHub</a> and is aiming to have an initial implementation ready  by early Q3 2022. They have published the first draft of the database schema they are proposing for building out the custom tables and feedback is welcome on the post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For this project, we expect that some work may be required by extensions and custom code developers to take full benefit of the new table structure,&#8221; Vedanshu Jain said. &#8220;As we go further along in the implementation, we plan to publish upgrade guides to support the adoption of custom order tables.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;During the rollout, we aim to keep this feature strictly opt-in in the beginning, giving everyone enough time to make their shops compatible.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 03:23:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: Nick Diego Forks Core WordPress Block, Creates Social Sharing Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=128423\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:199:\"https://wptavern.com/nick-diego-forks-core-wordpress-block-creates-social-sharing-plugin?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=nick-diego-forks-core-wordpress-block-creates-social-sharing-plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4644:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Raise your hand if you have seen this before. <em>Yet another social sharing plugin.</em> But, with the block system, all things are new again. Some things simply need to be ported over from their former PHP-based equivalents. Others are fresh takes on old ideas, and a few may set the standard for years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nick Diego forked the core Social Icons block to create <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-sharing-block/\">Social Sharing Block</a>. Everything about it looks and feels like it is supposed to be in WordPress, so much so that he thinks it could be a candidate for inclusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I tried to replicate the Gutenberg file structure as much as possible,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s close, but they are doing some webpack wizardry. I would love to see this ultimately get included in the core in some form, but may be too niche. I am going to put together a draft PR at some point though after 5.9 is out and I am sure the plugin is 100% solid.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it may not ever land in WordPress, it will likely be a go-to solution as more and more users begin to use block themes. Currently, the plugin requires either WordPress 5.9 or the latest version of Gutenberg. It uses some newer components, but it does not make sense to make it backward compatible with earlier versions anyway. The block works best when coupled with the site editor, which requires a block theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Examples of different block design options.\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin deviates from the core block in one necessary way. Instead of users typing in the URL to their social profiles, the Social Sharing block automatically outputs the proper &#8220;sharer&#8221; URL for whichever service is selected. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It even handles email and print links. Outside of that, it currently supports 10 social networks:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Facebook</li><li>LinkedIn</li><li>Pinterest</li><li>Pocket</li><li>Reddit</li><li>Skype</li><li>Telegram</li><li>Tumblr</li><li>Twitter</li><li>WhatsApp</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Diego said via Twitter that he plans to support more services in future iterations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social Sharing Block is a prime example of the promise of the block system. In classic WordPress, users were limited to whatever design the developer made possible. Often, plugins would output sharing links automatically, and users would need to configure options via a settings page entirely detached from what it would look like on the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this block, users have flexibility. They have control over every aspect of how their social sharing links are output, at least within the limits of the site editor. Everything from the label to the colors to the preceding &#8220;share this&#8221; text is at their fingertips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is also one of the reasons I am already a fan of this young plugin. It does not try to do too much. It does not concern itself with design aspects outside of the social sharing list that it outputs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a simple thing. However, it represents the control that users have rarely seen. For example, I wanted to add the text &#8220;Share Via&#8221; before the social share buttons. This is not configurable via the block itself. Instead, I get to decide its layout through the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<img />Editor View\n\n\n\n<img />Single Post View\n\n\n\n\n<p>I hopped over to the site editor and opened the single post template to build that layout. I scrolled down to the post meta area and inserted a Row block. From that point, it was a matter of adding my custom text via a paragraph before inserting the social sharing links.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, it is such a simple thing. However, the control over how this appears on the front end cannot be understated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all third-party blocks are built like this. Far too often, they try to control the entire experience, creating what should be patterns instead. When developers treat blocks as self-contained components that do one thing well, it adds flexibility for users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also helps theme authors when deciding which plugins to support. It would be a no-brainer for themers to build custom patterns and block styles around Social Sharing Block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also has one extra option that the WordPress Social Icons block does not. Users can enable the text label alongside each icon. During our conversation, I hinted that this was something sorely needed for core&#8217;s Social Icons block and that there was already an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/31605\">open ticket for it</a>. Diego seems interested in creating a patch to address it.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 00:33:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WordCamp Central: WP Y’all has been Postponed until the Spring\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/?p=3144092\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/news/2022/01/17/wp-yall-has-been-postponed-until-the-spring/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:323:\"<p>The WordCamp Birmingham Organizing Team has unanimously decided to postpone WP Y’all until a future date in April or May when we can safely hold the event for our attendees.</p>\n<p>See our <a href=\"https://birmingham.wordcamp.org/2022/wordcamp-birmingham-postponed-until-spring/\">full announcement</a> on our site.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 12:35:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Ryan Marks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 23: A letter from WordPress’ Executive Director\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=12043\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/01/episode-23-a-letter-from-wordpress-executive-director/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6739:\"<p>As we greet a new year, WordPress&#8217; Executive Director writes a letter to the project and community that speaks to the hopes of the year ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday marked three years since the WordPress project welcomed me as their executive director. As I start my fourth year, I&#8217;ve spent a bit of time considering what the next five years will bring us. WordPress will turn 19 this year, which means that we will soon be a whopping 20 years old; for some of the people who have been with the project since the beginning, that can represent two-thirds of their whole life. And even if you were not that young when you got here, two decades as an open source project is really a cause for celebration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not in that group that has been here forever. I showed up for the first time in 2009, as a community organizer, self-sponsored, and I learned so much about myself as a person and as a leader while I was doing that. So when I arrived as a sponsored contributor in 2015, I already knew exactly what made this work so fulfilling for me was these three things:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, the ability to lend a hand in those moments where I wish someone had lent a hand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second is the delight of seeing people&#8217;s first successes and the joy of watching them grow over time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:48</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third was a chance to be part of something great, which turned out to be something greater; greater than me or you or a CMS.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This list is still at the heart of what I feel I get out of the WordPress project. But it has also grown substantially in my seven years as a sponsored contributor. I now also love how we as a community of contributors get to foster a better way to lead and a better way to collaborate. And through those things help people find a way to have a better life. Not just through WordPress, the CMS, but through WordPress, the people, and WordPress, the project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so when I think of what I want for WordPress in its 19th year, so that we can head with confidence and dignity into our 20th year, it is this:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want you to remember that you are not alone here. People come together in the world often because of a shared location. But WordPress fosters this beautiful experience of bringing us together because of what we care about. Whether you care about PHP standards, diversity in technology, helping people with their first big wins, making WordPress more secure. I mean, if what you care about is being able to write the most arcane and complex apps on top of WordPress that the world has ever seen. Then there are others out there who want to do that with you, too. We have so many things to connect about. And fortunately, we support a great piece of software for getting our thoughts out in the world. Take some time to see who else shares your thoughts and potentially learn a bit about the view from the other side.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of the other side, I also want us to approach our discussions as the US versus the Problem TM. WordPress may be 20 years old, and we may stand on the shoulders of giants, but right now, the people who are here you, you are explorers and creators and guides toward the best possible future for WordPress. The tension that we witness between teams is always about the best possible answers for the people who use our software. It is about securing the freedoms of the open web for everyone who comes after us whether they know they need those freedoms or not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, I want us to expand our reasons for doing this at all. If you are a member of the community of contributors, We frequently talk about how we give back because WordPress gave to us. Or if you are part of a Five for the Future group. You have heard that companies who have experienced success because of WordPress should commit 5% of their resources back to the project to ensure WordPress&#8217; long-term success. But the reason that I keep doing this, and hopefully a new reason for you to keep doing this is that we can take part in securing opportunities for future users of WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I want WordPress to be the best CMS. Yes, I want this community to be vibrant and engaged. Yes, I want WordPress to be a shining beacon of how to work remotely. And I want all of that because I know it is our careful and tireless stewardship of this project that lets us continue to lend a hand in those moments where people wish for someone to lend a hand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are my hopes for WordPress in 2022 to move us forward into WordPress of the future. I hope you all will come with me and we can continue our journey together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks again for listening. I&#8217;m Josepha Haden and this is the WP Briefing. See you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Chloe Bringmann\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"Gutenberg Times: Level Up with Query Block, FSE for Classic Themes and more – Weekend edition #199\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=19873\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:135:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/level-up-with-query-block-fse-for-classic-themes-and-the-customizer-isnt-going-anywhere-weekend-edition-199/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20519:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I am so happy to be back in Florida, and I enjoy the warmth of the sun, and the palm trees. ☀️ ⛱️ 🌴.

Organizers had been planning the event since August 2021 and had just announced the last group of speakers a week ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In the last 30 days, our local COVID-19 numbers have risen dramatically as a result of the highly-transmissible Omicron variant,&#8221; lead organizer Ryan Marks said in the announcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The WordPress community is bigger than any single WordCamp. We cannot in good conscience continue forward with our event, given the current risk, since this decision could negatively impact other in-person WordCamps currently in the planning stages.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marks said all attendees will be automatically refunded within the next few days.

Their contract with the Sidewalk Film Center + Cinema allowed organizers to cancel without any loss of deposit as long as they gave more than seven days notice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event&#8217;s COVID-19 safety protocols, which were written before Omicron was spreading in the area, came under greater scrutiny a week ago. Shortly thereafter, organizers <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-birmingham-updates-covid-19-protocols-amid-omicron-surge-wordcamp-europe-still-planning-for-in-person-event\">updated the guidelines</a> to have a more rigid masking requirement, but some attendees and sponsors had already decided not to attend due to current conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I’m still considering whether to go to Birmingham Alabama <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordCamp?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordCamp</a> in February.

After assessing the timing of the event and the level of community spread, they unanimously decided to that it was necessary to postpone. They had also reached the point where some of their payments would have been nonrefundable and needed to act in stewardship of their funds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We knew that being the first in-person US WordCamp was both a risk and a responsibility,&#8221; lead organizer Ryan Marks said. &#8220;If we could do it safely, other WordCamps in the US could do the same. If lots of people got sick, we&#8217;d set back US WordCamps such as Montclair, NJ, and Buffalo, NY, and possibly the global program as a whole from moving toward having safe in-person WordCamps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We saw news reports and estimates indicating Omicron cases would be peaking right as we were hosting WordCamp. That was sufficient for our organizing team to make the call to postpone. Pushing the event a couple months could mean a much safer event for everyone.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alabama has the second lowest percentage of vaccinated residents in the US, with just <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/coronavirus-covid-19/vaccine-tracker\">48.1%</a> fully vaccinated. The state currently has an average positive test rate of 37.4%. More than 25% of Alabama students have shifted to remote learning as more school systems have had to close due to record-breaking COVID rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our problem is we just don’t have enough adults to safely and effectively operate the school…in some cases, now we’re seeing up to 35% of the faculty report that they have COVID, or they’re close contact,&#8221; Alabama State Superintendent Eric Mackey told <a href=\"https://www.al.com/news/2022/01/1-in-4-alabama-students-back-to-remote-learning-as-covid-spreads.html\">AL.com</a>.

I have kept my eye on this plugin since its November 2021 beta release. The project promised that developers would be able to &#8220;effortlessly build custom blocks,&#8221; and I was finally ready to put that to the test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past two months, I have activated the plugin every so often. I knew a review of it would take me a while, and I would deactivate it before diving in. I kept feeling overwhelmed by the enormity of it &#8212; <em>there are tons of settings to configure</em>. The holiday season did not help either. I wanted to sit down with a clear head and decide whether this plugin was something developers in the WP Tavern audience should put in their toolbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The short answer: yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, at least you should give it a spin to see how it compares to similar plugins. This is a version 1.x project, so there are still some missing pieces. However, it will make client builds easier to put together without writing anything more than CSS for custom blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I first began using the plugin, I seemed to hit issue after issue. Like always, I was trying to run before I could walk. I like to test new plugins at full speed and often forget to stop and <em>RTFM</em>. With complex projects like Wicked Block Builder, I must remind myself that it is OK to seek help from the docs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin has a bit of a learning curve if you want to do anything advanced. My suggestion is to do the opposite of what I did. Start with a simple use case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, the plugin development team has a tutorial video that will have you building custom blocks in less than five minutes. I recommend following along when creating your first.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Once I hopped over that initial hurdle, using the plugin was a breeze.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin allows developers to add blocks, block categories, patterns, and pattern categories. I primarily focused on block creation. The plugin worked in much the same way as other pattern builders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following along with the tutorial video, I created a Resource Card block. It included an image, title, summary, and button.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Building the editor view for a custom block.\n\n\n\n<p>There are multiple tabs for developers to build out their blocks. Aside from the primary Settings tab, most of the work will happen under Attributes and Editor View. The Front-end View is only necessary if the block&#8217;s output does not match what it looks like in the editor. The screen also has a Styles panel for adding custom CSS, which is loaded for the editor and front-end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UI seems mostly straightforward when following along with the tutorial. However, there are tons of options, and it is easy to get lost once you start digging into them all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once I pieced together my custom block, it correctly appeared in the inserter. I also tested a slash command for <code>/resource card</code> to ensure it worked.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting custom block into the editor.\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of missing features I immediately noticed once inserting my block was a custom icon and example/preview. Both are relatively simple to add when creating a block type from code, so I hope they are on the agenda for a future version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While searching for the custom block type via the inserter worked, I would also welcome an option to create custom keywords.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I filled in the details of the Resource Card block and saved it.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Block content customized.\n\n\n\n<p>To my surprise, I did not break anything. I began wondering, <em>Could creating blocks be this easy?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ran through a few other simple block ideas, and the experience was enjoyable. While I no longer work with clients, I could see how this could save hours. Pairing it with <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-templates/#locking\">template locking</a> would also be a routine use case so that clients would only need to plug in their content and publish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-supports/\">block-supported features</a> that I would like to see added. The plugin currently allows devs to enable alignment and wide alignment. However, others like spacing, typography, and color would be easy wins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tested the free version of the Wicked Block Builder. For simple blocks, it worked well. For more complex use cases, developers will need to upgrade to the <a href=\"https://wickedplugins.com/plugins/wicked-block-builder/\">pro version</a>. It runs between $49 and $299 per year, depending on the number of supported sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I have not tested the pro version, it does offer post and term selects, repeater fields, conditional logic, and inner-block support. After exhausting the basics, these will likely be necessary on some projects. However, the free version can still get you pretty far.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 15 Jan 2022 00:42:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WPTavern: Creating Speech Balloons With the WordPress Block Editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=128271\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:177:\"https://wptavern.com/creating-speech-balloons-with-the-wordpress-block-editor?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=creating-speech-balloons-with-the-wordpress-block-editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4215:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I do not know how I overlooked <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/liquid-speech-balloon/\">LIQUID SPEECH BALLOON</a>. The plugin is less than a month shy of being three years old, and I follow block-related projects religiously. This one slipped through the cracks, at least until I haphazardly stumbled upon it when searching for something else entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also relatively popular for a single-block plugin. There are not that many with more than 10,000 active installs. I had to know what it was doing to draw such a crowd.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattics-livro-is-a-minimal-block-theme-for-writers#comment-412254\">comments on yesterday&#8217;s post</a> about Automattic&#8217;s Livro theme, Nick Hamze wanted to know where all the fun theme designs were. Perhaps it was fortuitous timing that I also happened to be playing around with a plugin that might fit the bill. Sure, it is not a theme, but it can definitely be used to spruce up an otherwise boring or plain design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I spun up a few Speech Balloon blocks and just had fun creating a chat with a some cartoon animals:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting and customizing multiple Speech Balloon blocks.\n\n\n\n<p>I tend to gravitate toward clean, open-canvas themes because they allow me to add all the fun elements via the post content. That is why I love finding plugins like LIQUID SPEECH BALLOON. They add that visual flair to pages that can sometimes be boring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the plugin&#8217;s Speech Balloon block is straightforward. It presents users with a single section for inserting rich text content.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Default Speech Balloon block.\n\n\n\n<p>In the block options sidebar, users can choose an avatar. They can also make several design adjustments, including background and text colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block is falling slightly behind the times, though.  Since the plugin&#8217;s release nearly three years ago, WordPress has added several new design components that could be used to make its block even better, such as padding, border, and typography controls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin can also be used for testimonials or other types of reviews. It works well enough for more business-friendly layouts if that is the sort of thing you are after.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Creating testimonials with the Speech Balloon block.\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin&#8217;s biggest failure is in how it handles avatars. It is also why it does not make for the best option for testimonials. Users cannot add avatars directly via the block. Instead, they must register them via an entirely separate admin screen. Then, they can select from their saved avatars list within the block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the Settings &gt; LIQUID SPEECH BALLOON page, the plugin presents users with several rows of fields. They can add a name and image URL for each avatar.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Plugin&#8217;s avatar settings.\n\n\n\n<p>This is where the user experience falls apart a bit. There is no way to upload avatars on this screen. Instead, users must upload them via their media library, copy the URL, and paste it into the image URL field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin provides the necessary documentation and links to work through this process. The overall experience is simply lackluster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if users only need a limited number of avatars, the system works well enough once everything is uploaded. The images are always available whenever inserting the Speech Bubble block &#8212; no need to search through the media library or upload a new one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not sure if this will go in my plugin toolbox. Outside of a few stylistic elements, such as the speech bubble&#8217;s tail, users could readily recreate something similar with a few blocks, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom speech bubbles pattern.\n\n\n\n<p>Within a few minutes, I created this with what is already available in core WordPress, and I actually had several more design choices by doing so. I could see keeping a block pattern on hand for such a layout in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who want a quick and easy solution without all the fuss of mixing and matching blocks, LIQUID SPEECH BALLOON would be the better option.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 02:22:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WPTavern: Automattic’s Livro Is a Minimal Block Theme for Writers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=128178\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:173:\"https://wptavern.com/automattics-livro-is-a-minimal-block-theme-for-writers?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=automattics-livro-is-a-minimal-block-theme-for-writers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4992:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Sometimes the sweetest things in life are the simplest. Automattic&#8217;s latest block theme <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/110931\">landed in the review queue</a> yesterday, and I had to give it a spin. What I found was a minimally-elegant design that I fell in love with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Really</em>. I even dedicated an entire demo post on my install to it:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Single post with gallery and pull-quote.\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that and Valentine&#8217;s Day is a mere month away. It felt like the right time to mix up my install&#8217;s test content anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me preface the rest of this review by saying that I hate dark themes with a fiery passion. However, every now and again, one comes along that makes me rethink my position. Livro is one such theme. I may dislike it in a week, but I have genuinely loved using it for two days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme&#8217;s most impressive feat was using a single font family, <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Newsreader\">Newsreader</a>, across the entire design. It never felt like it needed anything else to separate body copy, secondary text, and headings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Livro will not meet everyone&#8217;s needs &#8212; not by a long shot. However, it is the sort of theme that will appeal to those who do not like any bells and whistles whatsoever. The type where content reigns supreme, where a few words and pictures are all that is necessary to make a point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did not immediately hop on this whirlwind affair with Livro at first sight. Things started a bit rocky. The theme managed to implement my top three pet-peeves:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>It displays post content instead of excerpts on blog/archive pages.</li><li>It shows the featured image at the top of the page on single posts, creating duplicate image output when that same image is used in the content.</li><li>Its navigation menu lists all of my site&#8217;s pages by default. All 90+ of them.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>One extra issue I noticed with the post content on the blog and archive pages was that wide and full-aligned blocks were the same width as normal content. I do not know if that is a WordPress or theme-specific issue. Since I planned on switching to excerpts, I did not look too deeply into the code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Navigation block issue is, in part, a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/37340\">problem with WordPress</a> itself. It will fall back to the core Page List block in specific scenarios. However, theme authors can also address this via the <code>block_core_navigation_render_fallback</code> hook, introduced in Gutenberg 12.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, all of these issues are dead simple to correct in the world of block themes. The site editor is just a click away, and users are no longer bound to the oddities of otherwise solid theme designs. In moments, I was able to customize how things looked.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Removing featured image from single posts via site editor.\n\n\n\n<p>The theme bundles 15 block patterns in total. Eight of them are for headers, and five are for footers. Most of these are variations on the same concept, primarily changing the position of the default elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was a little disappointed to not see more variety for page or general-use patterns. The theme ships one for an  About page and another for a Contact page. They both use an offset-column design that I hope one day gets dropped into the black hole where other web design trends go to die.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The nav menu&#8217;s &#8220;x&#8221; close button is on the far right edge of the screen, but the open icon is on the far left. This is more of a problem with WordPress&#8217;s handling of the Navigation block than the theme. Nevertheless, it is still irritating trying to find the close button. Ideally, the open and close buttons would always be in the same place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to mitigate this issue is to use the &#8220;Header with site title on left and button on right&#8221; pattern &#8212; <em>yes, all the short names were taken on header-pattern naming day</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Using a pattern to change the header design.\n\n\n\n<p>Users can switch it by modifying the Header template in the site editor. It puts the nav menu open button on the right side of the page. The close button will still be slightly off, but it is a better experience than the default.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a theme that I claim to love, I did focus on its downsides in this review. Part of that is to show that such issues need not always be the reason to overlook a block-based theme. If they are relatively minor problems, it does not take a programmer to make those adjustments. All of the design elements that I enjoyed about the theme were already there. It just needed some coaxing to make it perfect for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would still like to see the Automattic Theme Team add a few patterns to the mix. Livro&#8217;s clean canvas seems to invite a mashup of media and text blocks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 01:46:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"WPTavern: Extendify Launches New Pattern Library Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=128175\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:155:\"https://wptavern.com/extendify-launches-new-pattern-library-plugin?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=extendify-launches-new-pattern-library-plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4062:\"<p>Extendify has simplified access to its pattern library with a new <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/extendify/\">plugin</a> that offers patterns and full-page layouts for WordPress sites using Gutenberg-friendly themes. The company has high expectations for the product, publishing it under the name &#8220;Extendify&#8221; as its flagship free plugin in the official directory. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although a different version of the pattern library is included in Extendify&#8217;s popular <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/redux-framework/\">Gutenberg Template Library &amp; Redux Framework</a> plugin, which has more than a million active installs, this new plugin is focused simply on site design tools. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If you’ve tried out the Extendify Library previously, then you’ll find this new version is completely refreshed,&#8221; Extendify&#8217;s Head of Product Rich Tabor said. &#8220;We rebuilt the library, and all our patterns/layouts, from the ground up — with a focus on augmenting the editing experience of both existing and new themes.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Extendify functions as a SaaS connector plugin that uses a custom API to fetch block patterns and page layouts from the company&#8217;s servers. Once installed, the plugin has no separate settings page. Extendify adds a &#8220;Library&#8221; button at the top of the editor to launch a modal with patterns and layouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t selected a &#8220;Site Type&#8221; in the sidebar of the modal, all the patterns and layouts will be black and white. Selecting a Site Type will update the previews to show insert industry-specific copy and pictures with color. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you find a page layout that you like, it&#8217;s easy to get a beautifully designed page in a matter of seconds. However, the way it is set up at the moment, free users only have access to five imports. Subscribers can get unlimited imports for <a href=\"https://extendify.com/pricing/\">$49.50/year</a> for one site. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users who are not planning to upgrade must be judicious about the patterns and layouts they choose to preview on the page. The plugin will warn free users about the remaining number of imports before proceeding. This mode of limitation may slow the plugin&#8217;s adoption, because users have to be careful about trying too many patterns and layouts on their sites. The plugin&#8217;s FAQs state that &#8220;Each user receives a limited number of imports completely free&#8221; but users would be better served by knowing that it&#8217;s a total of five imports before installing.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>One of the good things about the plugin is that it is theme-agnostic and the patterns and layouts should still work nicely, even if you decide to change themes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;All our patterns and layouts are built completely with core blocks, infused with a clever utility design system (which lets us have neat patterns <a href=\"https://library.extendify.com/library/hero-grid-images/\">like this one</a> and are built to be Full Site Editing / Block Theme first &#8211; although we support most themes that support Gutenberg properly),&#8221; Tabor said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, Extendify&#8217;s pattern library was only available as an SDK inside the company&#8217;s other related Gutenberg projects. This plugin makes it more accessible for site builders who only need the pattern/layout capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This effort was geared towards lowering that barrier and bringing the best of what we have to offer to anyone interested in building sites with the block editor,&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;The new Extendify plugin is really the first big push in this direction, but we’re also leaning in on other ways to augment the editing experience to better empower both small business owners and site builders alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Block themes are where the future is and we’re aiming for the pole position with this newest effort.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 23:16:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"Post Status: Impossibly Knotted Together: Meditations on the WordPress Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=92470\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"https://poststatus.com/impossibly-knotted-together/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10926:\"<h2 id=\"h-what-might-wordpress-community-4-0-look-like\">What might “<a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-community-40/\">WordPress Community 4.0</a>” look like?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is part of a conversation we\'d like you to join. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What were the good and bad features of the first three versions of the WordPress community? What were the major bugs? What should the Post Status community look like in 2022 — and beyond? What should leadership in this space look like? What are the principles that should drive it?

There’s a problem she’s working through and I mention someone who has been through something similar, in case it helps. She tells me about a resource I hadn’t heard of, and I’m excited to check it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years that follow, J and I remain WordPress friends. At various times we encounter each other at events, in elevators, at receptions, across hallways, during meals, in Slack. The conversation picks back up where it left off. “How’d that thing go?” “You did an awesome job navigating that conflict!” “How’s your new team at work?” “Congrats on that cool thing you launched!” Being a part of the WordPress community gives J and me an anchor point, a foundation, and we build on it from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many WordPress friends. I may not encounter them for months or years, and the connections may not always be as wide or deep as other friendships, but they have a special place in my heart. I smile when I notice them, online or in person. I celebrate their successes. I cherish our shared experience of building something together.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator logo is-style-default\" />\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-elders\">Elders</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\"><strong>We have to talk more about the role of elders in our community. </strong>Definitely not elder as in “old entitled men” but elder as in “someone with life experience and wisdom who can be looked to for guidance as the community evolves.” We are old enough as a community to have elders, whether we see them as such or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As communities go through transitions and face challenges, it’s often the elders who ground us and guide us. Not by wielding their power to keep order or fighting for the status quo, but by helping us weave the stories of our origins and past into our dreams for the future. This can happen in code, in community conversations, in documentation, or anywhere else.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elders can help us build relationships and connections across different parts of the community, promoting mutual respect and welcoming newcomers. Elders can pass down knowledge, teaching, and modeling cultural traditions and beliefs. Elders can deal with discrimination and oppression, using their standing to call out problematic behavior. Elders can help build sustainable infrastructure, making sure there are tools and services in place for the challenges we will face. Elders can help protect our identity while also helping us to adapt and evolve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do WordPress community elders see themselves and their role? If they aren’t being celebrated for committing the latest hotness to an upcoming release or giving an exciting WordCamp talk, do we let them just fade into the background? If they branch out into other interests beyond WordPress, do we still find ways to harness their experiences and wisdom? Do we take care of them as they take care of us?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do our elders even know they are elders? Are you a WordPress community elder?</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator logo is-style-default\" />\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-a-recipe-for-community\">A Recipe for Community</h2>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-verse\">Small enough that you can make a difference\nBig enough that you can grow\nComfortable enough that you feel supported\nChallenging enough that you stay flexible\nFilled with people who want the best for you\nIntentional places and spaces for celebrating\nJust enough certainty to create a sense of purpose\nJust enough uncertainty to keep us humble\nNorms, ground rules and accountability\nPatience and respect built on safety and care\nCreative, kind and loving acts at the heart\nWhen people get a taste, they wonder\nWho created this, and how can I be a part of it? </pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator logo is-style-default\" />\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-matt-factor\">The Matt Factor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\"><strong>I was a WordPress user and developer for 10 years before I knew who Matt Mullenweg is.</strong> I’d bet that most WordPress users still don’t know who he is. And yet conversations about what Matt wants, what Matt thinks, what Matt is going to do sometimes play an outsized role in our community. People can worry when they think a thing they love or depend on is too much in the hands of forces they don’t know or understand. Nobody wants a broken heart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a time I ended up working for Matt, reporting to Matt. I discovered that he has a superpower: he can see around corners and beyond horizons in ways that few other people can. I’d suspect time travel is involved if I didn’t know better. Sometimes he has trouble bringing the rest of us along, like trying to show a 19th-century carpenter the schematics for a space station. Other times, I think it’s just too many hearts and hopes and dreams for one person to carry gently. But on the whole, Matt is responsible for leading us to some amazing milestones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When things go well, Matt usually credits people in the community. When things aren’t going well, Matt usually gets or takes the blame. When we challenge him thoughtfully, he usually welcomes the growth and learning that goes with it. But Matt knows that WordPress and the WordPress community are bigger than him. I think he’s happy to be a part of building a thing that will outlive him, and probably all of us. He’s made it his life’s work. We can honor and celebrate that legacy without reservation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a community, we can also build for a future that does not depend on any one person. We can make sure there’s a plan for maintaining our “commons.” There are other superpowers out there; I bet you have at least one to contribute. If we do it right, a shared vision for our community’s future will come from everyone who loves or benefits from WordPress in some way.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator logo is-style-default\" />\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-resilience\">Resilience</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">When <a href=\"https://www.ic.org\">intentional communities</a> form in the real world, their members think about the characteristics that will make their community resilient, sustainable, and able to thrive. These characteristics might include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Human scale</li><li>Control, influence, trust</li><li>Connection</li><li>Shared purpose</li><li>Continuity</li><li>Diversity</li><li>Collaboration</li><li>Welcoming and supportive</li><li>Clear decision-making processes</li><li>Knowledge sharing</li><li>Respect and pride</li><li>Safety</li><li>Good communication</li><li>Cooperative</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We can’t always choose our fellow community members and software that powers a huge chunk of the web is hard to make small and local again. But what can we learn from intentional communities? When you examine the physical places and spaces in your world that feel most welcoming, thriving, and sustainable, what do you notice?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do we want to create community experiences that are not so small as to preclude diversity, space, and freedom, but small enough to be accessible and not overwhelming? How can we make the daily experience of being in the WordPress community more personal, meaningful, and accessible?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If real-world communities have a distinct center, defined boundaries, smaller sub-centers of activity, and open areas flowing all around, what does that look like for the WordPress community? How can we make sure our community spaces evolve to support interactive and supportive social structures?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As pandemics and climate crises and polarization and uncertainty circle around us, what would it mean to feel grounded and safe in a resilient WordPress community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Adapted in part from Chapter 4 of Norwood and Smith’s “Rebuilding Community in America” (1995).</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-we-are-at-the-beginning\">We Are at the Beginning</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Even with its wonderful diversity and global reach, I don’t think we’ve even begun to explore the WordPress community niches that exist out there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could probably have a gathering for Canadian WordPress developers under 40 who specialize in funeral home websites and get a solid showing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There could be an entire weekly newsletter devoted to tips for pet adoption and rescue organizations who use WordPress to help animals find their forever homes, and someone would still suggest it needs to come out daily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trials and tribulations of the Restaurants On WordPress scene are waiting to be chopped apart, lightly sauteed and served up with a side of Food Blogger Business Models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are WordPress sub-communities and sub-cultures and niches and nooks and crannies that would take a lifetime to begin uncovering and exploring. There are so many stories to tell, and so many of them are nothing like our own. If we are to appreciate the beauty of the WordPress community as a whole, we have to seek them out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beware anyone who tells you that they fully understand the WordPress community, or that they have their finger on the pulse of all things WordPress. Some of us have made more stops than others, but we are all travelers in a wonderful vastness that has no end.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator logo is-style-default\" />\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 23:00:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"Akismet: How to Stop Comment Spam in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=2188\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://blog.akismet.com/2022/01/12/how-to-stop-comment-spam-in-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23916:\"<p>Comment sections can be goldmines for engaging with your audience. Yet unmoderated comments can quickly descend into chaos. If you don’t <a href=\"https://docs.akismet.com/general/spam-facts/\">keep an eye out for spam</a>, it may overrun every comment section on your website. These messages can scare real readers away, and prevent them from interacting with other users (and with you).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, spam is easy to recognize. Users or guests will leave links to other websites without explaining why, or start talking about products and services that have nothing to do with your content. If you put measures in place to stop these messages, you can keep your comment sections protected and valuable to your audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we’re going to take a good look at how spam appears in a comment section. We’ll show you how to identify spam comments on your WordPress websites, and talk about how they negatively affect your website. Finally, we’ll show you eight ways to prevent comment spam in WordPress. Let’s get to it!</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-2188\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-comment-spam\">What is comment spam?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use the internet, you’re already familiar with spam. You probably get dozens of emails per week advertising fraudulent products and offers. But spam messages don’t just come in the shape of emails — they’re everywhere on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spammers tend to gravitate towards comment sections because they offer the opportunity to target a broad audience. On popular blogs, it’s not uncommon to have comment sections with dozens of users engaging in discussion. A single spam comment pointing to another website can easily get a few clicks, and even more so if it blends into the conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Generally speaking, comment spam is any content with the sole purpose of pointing visitors towards other websites. Spam commenters may be trying to get people to buy or sign up for something, phish sensitive information from visitors, or install malware on their device. <em>Occasionally</em> you’ll see legitimate comments that point readers towards third-party websites, but these links have to make sense in the context of the discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be tempting to simply ignore comment spam, but that can have a negative impact on your website. If you visit a site and you see that its comment sections are overrun with spam messages, you might not trust its content or the business that owns it. We’ll touch on other ways that spam can affect your site, but first let’s talk about how to spot this type of comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-identify-comment-spam\">How to identify comment spam</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Spam comments tend to be very easy to spot. In a lot of cases, bots — not actual people — are behind them. These bots are programmed to target comment sections that don’t require any type of verification and post messages that will lead readers to third-party websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re ever on the fence about whether a comment is spam or not, there are several signs that you can check for. Signs of comment spam include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The comment comes from a guest account or one with a generic name</li><li>The user doesn’t have an avatar</li><li>The comment includes links to third-party websites</li><li>There are mentions of products, services, and benefits to readers</li><li>The comment has little or nothing to do with the discussion at hand</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"trolls-vs-spam\">Trolls vs spam</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, you might get comments in poor taste or that don’t add anything to the discussion. Those commenters may be genuine in their opinions and honestly think that they’re contributing to the community, or they may be trolling. But those comments are not necessarily spam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a couple of key differences between trolls and spam. Trolls are real people and spam is most often spread by bots. Also, a troll’s main goal is to disrupt discussion, sow division, and elicit emotional responses from other individuals. The main goal of spam is usually some kind of financial gain, whether it’s an unethical (but genuine) marketing tactic, or an attempt to scam people.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"why-are-comment-spam-bots-targeting-your-website\">Why are comment spam bots targeting your website?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re working on your first WordPress website, you may think that spam bots have it out for you. Unfortunately, comment spam is something that almost <em>every </em>website has to deal with (unless you turn comments off entirely).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bots crawl the web looking for comment sections that they can target. They don’t differentiate between sites that are and are not relevant to the websites, products, and services that they’re promoting. For spammers, it’s all a matter of numbers. If they leave thousands of comments across many different websites, at least <em>some </em>readers will take the bait.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of those users will go on to share personal information or even payment details that spammers can steal. In some cases, spammers might benefit directly from making sales to users who aren’t aware of their underhanded practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comment sections can be an incredible source for engaging discussions and ideas within your website. They can encourage users to look out for new posts and build relationships with other commenters. On the other hand, the price that you pay for having a comment section is needing to deal with spam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, WordPress empowers you with several tools and features that make dealing with spam comments that much easier. We’ll explore those in a second, but for now let’s talk about the rest of the ways that spam comments can affect your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"four-ways-that-spam-comments-negatively-affect-your-website\">Four ways that spam comments negatively affect your website</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-spam-comments-diminish-trust\">1. Spam comments diminish trust&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you come across a website that looks credible, but it’s full to the brim with spam comments, you might believe that the site is abandoned. At the very least, you’ll tell yourself that its owners might not care about cleaning up their comment sections, or that they don’t pay attention to comments at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more obvious the spam is, the more negatively it will impact your website’s image.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Tech-savvy users might not judge you too harshly for having spam on your website, since they understand where it comes from. But not all of your audience will know that they should ignore spam comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some users will see spam and think that since it’s on your website, you’re endorsing it or promoting the offers the comments include. If that translates to them making a scam purchase or sharing personal information online, it will diminish their trust in you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a website with a comment section, it’s your responsibility to keep it clean, and not just so that your site looks better. You have to consider that some of your audience doesn’t have the technical know-how to differentiate spam offers from real content, and it’s your job to ‘protect’ them while they’re on your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-real-comments-can-get-lost-among-spam-entries\">2. Real comments can get lost among spam entries</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a user trying to have a real discussion in a comment section, navigating spam can be frustrating. Genuine replies to the topic at hand can easily get lost as bots overrun the comment section.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That frustration can lead to users deciding that commenting on your content is simply not worth it. Comments can be a great source for critical discussion about your posts, questions that can lead to new content, and even users simply thanking you for your efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you allow spam to run unchecked on your website, you lose out on a lot of the value that comment sections can provide. At that point, you might be better off disabling comments altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-spam-can-impact-your-website-s-search-engine-optimization-seo\">3. Spam can impact your website’s search engine optimization (SEO)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting a website to rank well on search engines takes a lot of time and effort. Often, it can take months or even years to grow a website to the point where it’s getting decent traffic from search results. That process involves dozens of SEO tasks, tweaking your pages and posts so they&#8217;re well-optimized, and publishing better content than your competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, spam comments can <a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/blog/content-spam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">negatively impact your SEO</a> if you leave them unchecked. Most spam includes links to external websites, and search engines can’t differentiate between those links and the ones that you include within your content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the search engine’s perspective, all they see is that your website suddenly includes a lot of ‘low-value’ links. Since links are one of the many signals that search engines use to determine rankings, spam comments can cause your site to plummet in the results.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering how critical search engine traffic is to most websites’ growth, you can’t allow spam comments to linger on your site. That’s why you need to put measures in place to prevent spam, and to weed it out if it makes it past your defenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"4-spam-can-slow-down-your-website\">4. Spam can slow down your website</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re getting a lot of spam bots attempting to submit comments, these requests can affect your website’s performance. If your site is having to handle thousands of spam submissions a day, that can use up a lot of your site’s resources —&nbsp;especially if you’re on a budget hosting plan. Additionally, if you let spam comments pile up, you may end up with some serious database bloat, further slowing your site’s load times.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your readers have to wait a long time for your pages to render, they’re less likely to stick around to read your content, let alone leave a comment (unless it’s to complain about how slow your site is).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-prevent-comment-spam-in-wordpress\">How to prevent comment spam in WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, we wouldn’t blame you if you’re very concerned. Spam causes a lot of problems, and it’s almost guaranteed that bots will try and post these types of messages on your site. So what can you do about it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that WordPress offers a variety of ways in which you can prevent and filter spam comments from your WordPress website. In this section, we’ll explore all of the approaches that you can take to prevent spam and protect your comment sections.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-use-a-plugin-to-filter-spam-comments\">1. Use a plugin to filter spam comments</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to deal with spam is to use a plugin that can automatically detect which comments are legitimate and which ones aren’t. That’s a lot to ask from a plugin, but it’s precisely what <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/\">Akismet</a> does.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>When you use Akismet, the plugin analyzes each comment that visitors submit on your website. It accesses Akismet’s global database and checks to see if the comments match other known spam entries and sources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of that happens in the background, in a matter of seconds. If Akismet marks a comment as spam, it’s flagged and it doesn’t get published. Fortunately, you can also review these comments manually, to double-check that no real entries get flagged by mistake.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to approve a comment, you can mark it for publication and it will show up on your website. But you save a lot of time by focusing only on the comments that Akismet flags versus reviewing every comment submission manually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a free version of the plugin, which is perfect for most websites. On the other hand, if you’re running a commercial site or get a large volume of traffic, you’ll want to look into <a href=\"https://akismet.com/plans/\">premium plans</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-disable-wordpress-comments-altogether\">2. Disable WordPress comments altogether</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to stop spam altogether, you can disable comments throughout your website. This is an extreme approach, so we only recommend that you disable comments if you’re certain that they won’t contribute anything to your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/comments-in-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">disable comments in WordPress</a>, access your dashboard and go to <strong>Settings <em>→ </em>&nbsp;Discussion</strong>. Look for the section that reads <strong>Default post settings</strong><em> </em>at the top of the screen, and uncheck the <strong>Allow people to submit comments on new posts</strong><em> </em>option:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>That setting will disable comments for every post that you publish from now on. But comments will remain active for old posts and pages. To disable those comment sections, go into the <strong>Posts</strong><em> </em>or <strong>Pages</strong><em> </em>tab. Select a post or page, and click on <strong>Quick edit</strong><em> </em>below its name. You’ll see an option that reads <strong>Allow Comments</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>If that option is checked, disable it. Repeat this process for every page and post where you want to disable comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the type of website you’re running, disabling comments altogether might cost you some user engagement. Fortunately, there are other ways to reduce spam.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-force-users-to-register-before-they-can-comment\">3. Force users to register before they can comment</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to reduce comment spam in WordPress is to make it more difficult for bots to make submissions. Forcing bots to register and log in before they can comment can go a long way towards reducing spam entries on your posts and pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress enables you to do that by checking a single setting on your website. Go to <strong>Settings </strong><strong>→ </strong><strong>Discussion</strong><em> </em>and scroll down to the <strong>Other comment settings</strong><em> </em>section. Tick the box for the setting that reads <strong>Users must be registered and logged in to comment</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>By enabling that setting, you force spammers and bots to go through the registration process if they want to submit anything on your website. In a lot of cases, that can be enough to deter spammers. But since spam user registration does happen, you may have to implement a few more preventative measures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"4-hold-comments-for-approval-before-publishing-them\">4. Hold comments for approval before publishing them</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, WordPress publishes comments as soon as users submit them. It also comes with a moderation queue where you can review comments and approve or reject them before they go live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can configure WordPress so that your website requires you to approve every comment manually. To do so, go to <strong>Settings </strong><strong>→ </strong><strong>Discussion</strong><em> </em>and scroll down to the <strong>Before a comment appears section</strong>. Enable the setting that reads <strong>Comment must be manually approved</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also another setting that tells WordPress it can automatically publish comments if<em> </em>you’ve already approved submissions from the same user. That setting can save you a lot of time, as you’ll only have to review submissions from each user once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To access pending comments, click on the chat box icon in the top menu within the dashboard. That icon should display a number to its right, which shows the number of pending comments in the queue.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>From this screen, you can review comments one by one and approve those that aren’t spam. If you see a spam comment, you can delete it permanently.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"5-flag-comments-that-include-links-and-specific-terms\">5. Flag comments that include links and specific terms</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally speaking, there aren’t many situations where it makes sense for legitimate comments to include links. Your readers might want to point each other towards relevant content, but usually, comments that include links tend to fall into the spam category.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress offers an elegant solution to that problem by enabling you to configure how many links a comment can include before it gets flagged as spam. You can find that setting on the <strong>Settings </strong><strong>→ </strong><strong>Discussion </strong>page under the <strong>Comment Moderation</strong><em> </em>section.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>By default, WordPress will flag any comment that includes two or more links within its body. If you want to play it safe, you can reduce that number to one link. This means any comments that include links will go into the moderation queue to await your approval.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This section also enables you to set keywords that WordPress will use to flag comments. If it detects those words within new comments, WordPress will hold them in the moderation queue. Some common keywords that you can set include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Buy/sell</li><li>Make/earn money</li><li>Offer</li><li>Stock and shipment</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All of those keywords are pretty good indicators of spam comments. You can be as aggressive as you want when it comes to choosing what terms to filter, but keep in mind that this means you’ll need to spend more time approving comments manually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than deciding what keywords to ‘blocklist’ on your own, you can also benefit from the collective experience of the WordPress community. For example, you might download the recommended <a href=\"https://github.com/splorp/wordpress-comment-blacklist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Comment Blacklist for WordPress</a> that’s featured on GitHub.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"6-add-a-captcha-to-your-comment-sections\">6. Add a CAPTCHA to your comment sections</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You may have noticed that a lot of comment sections force you to solve a CAPTCHA before you can submit an entry. <a href=\"https://blog.akismet.com/2021/12/23/do-captcha-and-recaptcha-protect-wordpress-sites-from-bots/\">CAPTCHAs are simple tests</a> designed to stop bots from posting and ensure that you’re a human.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress doesn’t include CAPTCHA functionality out of the box. The good news is that you can easily add this feature using a plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-captcha/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reCaptcha</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This plugin enables you to add CAPTCHAs to multiple elements within your website. You can add them to comment sections, registration and login forms, contact forms, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If visitors (or bots) can’t solve the CAPTCHAs, they won’t be able to submit comments. But CAPTCHAs don’t always catch every spam comment. Bots become smarter each day and often find ways around even the trickiest of puzzles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"7-use-a-third-party-comment-system\">7. Use a third-party comment system</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress comment system works seamlessly and includes a lot of features to make your life easier. Yet it lacks things like social media integration and the ability for visitors to reply using images or GIFs, emoticons, and other options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to give your audience access to that type of functionality, you can replace the default WordPress comment system with a different one altogether. There are plenty of WordPress plugins that enhance your comment section:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpdiscuz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>wpDiscuz</strong></a><strong>: </strong>This plugin extends the native WordPress comment system and adds new options like custom layouts, live notifications, responsive comment sections, and more.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gs-facebook-comments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>WP Social Comments</strong></a><strong>: </strong>With this plugin, visitors will be able to use their Facebook account to leave comments on your website.</li><li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/super-socializer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Super Socializer</strong></a><strong>: </strong>This plugin enables you to use the Facebook commenting system in WordPress and lets users log in with their social media accounts.</li><li><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/features/discussion/comments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Jetpack Comments</strong></a>: Visitors can log in using their social media accounts, like other people’s comments, and receive a notification when another user replies.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Comment plugins that include social media components offer a fantastic way to reduce spam in WordPress. By forcing users to log in through social media to comment, you make it harder for spammers to submit fake entries on your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"8-set-up-a-web-application-firewall-waf\">8. Set up a web application firewall (WAF)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a WAF can help you prevent attackers from accessing your website. WAFs enable you to configure rules that govern who can use your site. That means you can block IP addresses, visitors from specific regions, bots that try to access your site repeatedly in short amounts of time, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve ever run into a website that uses <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/waf/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cloudflare</a> or <a href=\"https://sucuri.net/website-firewall/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sucuri</a>, then you’ve already seen WAFs in action. Most content delivery networks (CDNs) offer WAF functionality, since it helps them protect their users against malicious traffic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a CDN will also help you improve load times throughout your website. Depending on which service you use, you might also get access to features like automatic image optimization, denial of service (DDoS) protection, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some CDNs will help protect your website against known bots and spammers. Simply enabling the CDN will block those known agents from accessing your website and being able to leave comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"spam-is-unavoidable-but-it-can-be-defeated\">Spam is unavoidable, but it can be defeated</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have comment sections on your website, you’re going to be faced with spam. Spam bots are <em>everywhere</em>, and if you ignore them, they can quickly overrun your comment sections with links to other websites and offers that will scare some of your real visitors away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, WordPress offers a number of ways to deal with comment spam. You can use built-in settings to make it harder for spammers to submit responses to your posts and pages. You can also use plugins that automatically filter out easily recognizable WordPress comment spam, add CAPTCHAs to your comment sections, or require visitors to log in using their social media accounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want a simple but effective solution, you can begin by <a href=\"https://akismet.com/plans/\">setting up Akismet</a>. This plugin will automatically filter spam comments on your WordPress website, so you don’t have to spend time going over your entire moderation queue manually. Akismet also integrates with some of WordPress’ most popular plugins like Jetpack, Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms, Formidable Forms, and others.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 10:09:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Simon Keating\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"WPTavern: What Are Block Themes?

The upcoming release will be the most monumental shift in how the platform works since the introduction of the block-based content editor in 5.0. Block themes, global styles, and the site editor will kick-start a new future for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the average WP Tavern reader, this is not news. We have covered block themes here for over a year. For those out of the loop, there is a lot to catch up on within the next two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the complaints with the launch of the block editor in 2018 was that users could only opt-out of using it by installing Classic Editor or a related plugin. This is not the case for the new features in 5.9. Users can keep on using their current setup without any changes at all. Accessing the site editor and global styles is an opt-in process. It requires the activation of a block theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upcoming changes will affect two primary groups of users. The first are those who prefer to run the latest default WordPress theme. The second will be those ready to try out the new system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, there are <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/\">35 block themes in the directory</a> on WordPress.org, with more in the review queue. That limits the available options for now. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />Block themes from WordPress.org.\n\n\n\n<p>After WordPress 5.9 launches and developers become more familiar with building on the new system, I expect that we will see a noticeable uptick in block themes in the coming months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>this post focuses on user-facing changes. If you are a developer who wants to get started with block theme design, read Marcus Kazmierczak&#8217;s overview of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/01/04/block-themes-a-new-way-to-build-themes-in-wordpress-5-9/\">building block themes for WordPress 5.9</a></em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"twenty-twenty-two\">Twenty Twenty-Two</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Twenty Twenty-Two theme about page template.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The latest default WordPress theme, Twenty Twenty-Two, will launch alongside version 5.9. While I have a few nit-picks about it, it might just be my all-time favorite default theme ever created.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/01/wordpress-5-9-rc-2/\">WordPress 5.9 RC 2</a> was released earlier today. Now is as good a time as any to give it a test run. Twenty Twenty-Two is already bundled with this version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As is often the case with default themes, it is likely to become the <em>de facto</em> standard in which developers build their own projects. It uses all the latest features and is one of the most up-to-date themes out there. This makes it the ideal starting point for users who want to test the new system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme is merely one component of a broader system. For users, it can be something they set and forget. Or, they can take it to the next level and customize their front end until their heart is content.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"site-editor-and-global-styles\">Site Editor and Global Styles</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Block themes are different than many traditional themes. In the classic era, users activated a theme and customized whatever options the developer made available. It was a rigid system that often did not give users much flexibility unless they knew how to write code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can access a boatload of new features after activating a block theme. This is done via the site editor, located under the Appearance > Editor admin screen. Users can modify their theme templates directly on the canvas and customize their design through the global styles panel.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Site editor with global styles panel open (right).\n\n\n\n<p>The first experience with the site editor can be overwhelming. Some might prefer diving right in, while others take a different approach. Regardless of how you learn, I recommend going through the <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/course/simple-site-design-with-full-site-editing/\">Simple Site Design with Full Site Editing</a> course from Learn WordPress. The Training team has created a 15-lesson plan that walks you through everything you need to know. They also have a six-minute <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/workshop/how-to-style-your-site-with-global-styles/\">workshop on using global styles</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the site editor can be fun, but it can also be frustrating. This is essentially a &#8220;version 1.0&#8221; of the feature. It will not meet everyone&#8217;s needs with its launch in two weeks. It will take some time to mature and for theme authors to build on top of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spent over a decade building themes professionally. One of the most common questions I got was, &#8220;How do I change the post meta area?&#8221; Users would want to remove the author, move the category list, and do numerous other things. No amount of theme options covered every scenario. I often resorted to walking non-coders through making changes to their theme templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Except in the most complex cases, this problem no longer exists. Through the site editor, users can choose what appears.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom post byline/meta.\n\n\n\n<p>I wish we had such a system a decade ago. It would have saved me hours of support work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, this is a simple example of what is possible with the site editor. Everything from changing bits of a template to creating an entire custom color palette is mere mouse-clicks away from reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the possibilities are not boundless. There are limitations that users will undoubtedly run into as they get more and more advanced with design ideas. Contributors have taken massive strides to get this first version ready for WordPress 5.9. And, there will be more to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"customizer-widgets-and-nav-menus\">Customizer, Widgets, and Nav Menus</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The most shocking thing for those who have been out of the loop will likely be the disappearance of the customizer, widgets, and nav menus admin screens. These components are replaced by the site editor when using a block theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some known issues related to the customizer, such as no custom CSS option, live previews, or site icon setting. I covered this in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/customizer-will-disappear-for-some-block-theme-users-with-wordpress-5-9\">more detail in a previous post</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nav menus are now handled via the Navigation block:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Selecting a nav menu.\n\n\n\n<p>It could take some getting used to. While I am a fan of the block system, I, admittedly, still prefer managing menus via the classic screen. However, I am starting to come around. The contributors who have been working on the block have made the experience far better than it was just a few months ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for dynamic sidebars and widgets, they are gone, at least in the traditional sense. Everything is a block now. Theme authors can create columns or containers that look like sidebars of the past, but they are all managed via the site editor. And, users can stick any block they want anywhere.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 02:11:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.9 to Introduce New API for Locking Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=128129\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:171:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-9-to-introduce-new-api-for-locking-blocks?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-5-9-to-introduce-new-api-for-locking-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2675:\"<p>The advent of block themes delivers more creative power into the hands of users, but there are times when theme authors may want to lock down key elements of a design and its designated content areas. First <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-11-6-introduces-new-api-for-locking-blocks\">introduced in Gutenberg 11.6</a>, the upcoming WordPress 5.9 release will include a new API for locking blocks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Template level locking has been available in Gutenberg for a few years, allowing developers to lock the template on the UI so that users can&#8217;t manipulate the blocks. This new API offers more granular control that can be applied on the block level and override template locking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Instead of applying a lock to all inner blocks, you can apply it selectively to individual blocks via the <code>lock</code> attribute,&#8221; Marcus Kazmierczak said in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/01/08/locking-blocks-in-wordpress-5-9/\">dev note</a>. &#8220;The block level locking would supersede the inherited <code>templateLock</code> value. You can choose to lock moving or removing a block.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the primary use cases for locking individual blocks, cited in the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/29864\">ticket</a> proposing the new API, is where one might lock the &#8220;post-content&#8221; block of a <code>single</code> template so users can&#8217;t remove it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Another use case that we&#8217;re building for is having a Checkout Block with different blocks that act as fundamental steps, we don&#8217;t want people to delete or move those steps since they&#8217;re fundamental and their order is also important, but we want to allow people to select them, access settings, and insert blocks in between them,&#8221; WooCommerce engineer Seghir Nadir said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kazmierczak&#8217;s dev note demonstrates how developers can lock a specific block in a pattern and explained how block level locking is not inheritable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If a block is locked from being removed, its children can still be removed,&#8221; Kazmierczak said. &#8220;If you want to apply locking on children as well, add <code>templateLock</code> to the inner block component, or <code>templateLock</code> attribute to supporting blocks.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information on the new locking mechanism, check out the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-templates/#locking\">Block Editor Handbook</a> and the code examples in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/01/08/locking-blocks-in-wordpress-5-9/\">dev note</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 21:01:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.9 RC 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12014\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/01/wordpress-5-9-rc-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4916:\"<p>The second Release Candidate (RC2) for<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-9/\"> WordPress 5.9</a> is now available!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Release Candidate” means the new version of the software is ready for release.

It\'s a very simple post. It takes a minute to read it. If you are listening to this, now you should pull over to the side of the road, you know, stop watching your children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stop paying attention to the world. Take five minutes to read this and then come back to this because this is basically all we\'re discussing. So I\'m going to allow you to, in your own words, to explain, I think the easiest would be version 1.0,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> you know, as I thought about this and I\'ll just preface it a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was after listening to Cory Miller and Josh Strebel. Talk about the acquisition of Pagely so I\'ve listened to the podcast and they were talking about community. And I started thinking through, because I had thought about this before, so right away, I thought what version are, where app, because</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> and [00:01:00] version.You think version because we\'re into software, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> I even do a change log for my website. I\'ve gotten into change logs. Cause I think they\'re so cool. And they can be more than four erotic</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I do change logs for my kids, but I mean, that\'s another subject, but yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah. And I love that it\'s so I thought, okay, the version, the first version is, yeah, it\'s when WordPress, it was before my time, you know, cause I didn\'t get into it till 2017, but I thought there was app time that WordPress was new and it was doing its thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was you know, the little bit of glitter in Mullenweg\'s Eye. And you know, that was it. It was just as simple as that version. 1.0, is those first few years as this kind of found its legs</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> that would cover the years from about 2004, I think to about 2009. Yeah. Based on yours. And I use 2004. I don\'t know if anybody wants to go back earlier, but that\'s when [00:02:00] WordPress 1.0 was released 2004 to 2009 was the first generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I can tell you that I was, I came into WordPress maybe around 20, like encountering the software itself around the version when themes came out. So I\'m a little fuzzy on that. I was three, 1.3, 1.4. Maybe I\'m going to say 2005, maybe 2006, somewhere around there. And my dates could be off. So whatever I wasn\'t in the community, I was just by myself and I really didn\'t get into the community until maybe 2000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I am kind of in the middle of that version 1.0, because word camp Miami was started. Like we got together in 2008, me, John James Jacoby, who was down here and a few other people got together 2008 is when we started rearing up WordCamp Miami, there was no foundation or anything like that. So version 1.0 was there was no WordPress foundation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was maybe a couple of word camps going on at the end of 2009 work. Our first WordCamp Miami [00:03:00] would have been over by then, but we had no rules. We had people nationally would come because there were just so few word camps existing at the time. And you just expected the entire WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wa it was that where it\'s like, are you going? It\'s basically there\'s nothing else to do for this month. Let me, let\'s get, let\'s go down to Miami. That\'s how I remember the WordPress community at the time. I remember any of the big contributors. There were very few names that you associate with WordPress contributions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was mark Jake with um, he was a big name that you would talk about during contributorship at that time, but it was a really big pioneering days. I remember WP candy. I don\'t know if you remember WP candy, Brian, I believe I remember they covered our first WordCamp Miami, and they were just a bunch of people typing on laptops in the back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I didn\'t know that I, if I, man, if I knew him at the time. And our first work in Miami actually had a lot of people from the internet community involved like people, you would probably not no longer see it eventual WordCamps because [00:04:00] it was just generally about blogging customization. I did my.first BuddyPress talk, but it was just a room, maybe of 50 people listening to my presentation, but there was the WordPress community at a time that was just so new young, you would probably anybody you saw at that camper, the fewer there\'s at that time, that was the WordPress community. In a nutshell, anyone else that was doing WordPress at the time was just fiddling with it. You could go up and literally ask someone about a core ticket and it would only be melt maybe a half a dozen people that you would go up to a recognize and ask about a core ticket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they were co and there wasn\'t like a big committee back then, or a big, there was a team back then, but basically you\'re the, most of the team was sitting in the same room as you. There was no com contribution. There are no contributor days or anything. The people were actually committing code, I think, to WordPress during the conference, during the talks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that\'s how like fly by the seat of the pants. It was. So that to me was word, press version 1.0. [00:05:00] Everybody kind of knew everybody else. It was like one giant meetup. Yeah. And a lot of the rules, the red tape or whatever it is you want to call it just simply didn\'t exist. Social didn\'t exist. Social networking really didn\'t exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Friendster, I think was the hottest thing in social media at the time. And then in the iPhone, didn\'t come out 2007. One of the biggest things was just seeing your website on an iPhone or a mobile device back then, too. So that to me was version one. And thank you for allowing me to indulge you, Bob, because I thought you were part of that and I just didn\'t see you because I\'ve just taken it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'ve just assumed you\'ve always been around. I\'ve been feels that way. So version two, there is, so version two, according to your posts takes you from 2010 to 2018, and this is your Jen. This is your version, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Right. He is because when, so I started dabbling in WordPress in 2017 and. So I was coming from having run [00:06:00] a business, or I was still running a business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was in the, I think 15th year of it, a marketing design business. And I was looking at WordPress for blogging, for creating sites, you know, building sites. Cause I wasn\'t a developer during that time. So I was involved with like the business community in those years, which was in real life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, you lived in the community and you related with other businesses. And in the early around that same time, there was a online site called dot com and it no longer exists, but it was a very unique one of the first endeavors in bringing people online and it started in Seattle and it actually grew nationally and was a bit international and it did a mix of in-person and online events and you\'d network and you\'d, you know, comment and talk to each other on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it grew quite a bit. Yeah, I\'m not getting the whole story of that, but that was where I started to learn more about, or actually delve more into [00:07:00] the online community. WordPress just segwayed into my life easily. Cause I was already, you know, thinking community, you know, there\'s some kind of community wherever you go, of course, open source is very different to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was very embracing and it was like, wow, this is cool. You know, people are so different because it\'s not these chamber of commerce meetings. It\'s just a different feel to it. And I, you know, me I just started diving into it and by 2010 I said, okay, Totally closed down our other business and I\'m going to create this other brand that came up with Bob WP, which, you know, some people looked at me at that time said, you know, can I, why are you doing that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> It\'s like getting a tattoo. Right? It\'s like, listen, it seems cool now, but have you thought five years ahead?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> And you know, I, when I [00:08:00] started WordPress I started WordPress at the age of 50. So I was kind of different, you know, I mean, I had a different perspective cause I was later on in life. So I was looking at something new and exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that time I look back at it and I didn\'t realize it until later on in the years when I would talk to a lot of people that had been in the space at the same time. And I realized that they all were saying, yeah, you know, when I really got involved with WordPress was around 2009, 2010, or that\'s when I started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, there\'s all the big, you know, Yoast, gravity forums, all these ones that started around that period of time. And it just seemed like it was a time I came in at a prime time where there was this open innovation in WordPress where people were doing a lot of stuff and things are coming out left and right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was just, it was fascinating and themes were, you know, growing more and more. And [00:09:00] it just, I just dove into it and I thought I\'ve got to get into this community because it\'s just seems cool. I mean, the people, you know, who I\'ve related to. So I think my first, I don\'t know if I did a word camp in 2010 by now I was in Chicago in 2011 and I spoke at that and I, again, just went full force into it and went to these, the first word camp, I word camp, and thought, wow, this is really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to, you know, meet these people. And there was such a natural I don\'t know what you want to call it, but everybody seemed together. It was like,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> don\'t worry, we\'ll flesh it out. We\'ll flesh it out because this is part of the reason why I want to get into this overall, because I mean, I don\'t, you know, we\'ll go into each, we\'ll go into a little bit more depth on each one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was just trying to make, you know, for somebody who hasn\'t read the post is not listening to me and reading this first. We have, so, and here\'s also about that time period of two. When we say [00:10:00] version two was around 2010 right before 2010 is when Sandhills development. Awesome motive started 2009 is actually when WP beginner was launched by Syed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So like we say, 2010. And I think that was a good cutoff time because I think in 2009, It needed a little bit of ramping up it didn\'t and a lot of other companies too, I\'m just picking -. It\'s amazing Sandhills and Awesome Motive and WP beginner started around that time in late, I think, late 2009s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So version 2.0, started in 2010. According to your post, it ran for about eight years, till 2018, which we\'ll get to why in a second. And between that time, like I said, it\'s when those companies that we, that the mergers that were acquisitions that we\'re hearing about today from quote unquote, big companies, a lot of them got their start at the beginning of the 2.0 era.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> And yeah, so I think that\'s, that was a perfect time in your blog post to kind of, you know, make 2009, 2010, the next cutoff [00:11:00] point, because I think like earlier, when we just talked about everybody was just. If you had a problem with WordPress and people, weren\'t really starting to build really good businesses around WordPress in version 1.0, if you were building websites and if you were making good money, you usually just a big, good agency or you\'re just building websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then 2.0 era started with the companies actually building commercial products with plugins or for tutorial sites. And that\'s how I think, that\'s how I saw reflecting back because I was too ignorant to realize what was going on at the time. How 2.0 started in that kind of, like you said, when you got into the game 2016, 2017 near the closing of that particular era, it was going full force by then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, there weren\'t really a lot of acquisitions happening in this era. It was just a lot of businesses being created.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. And there was a lot of people that I\'ve met that weren\'t necessarily, you know, like. Doing the big business or doing the big [00:12:00] products, but they, I was still amazing. How many? Yeah, I started my agency around 2009, 2010.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that, just that number kept coming back at me and I thought, wow, I made a lot of sense because it\'s how I felt when I got into it. It was like, okay, something\'s happened in here, you know, and I seem to got into this at a really prime point in time</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that, that period too probably saw the biggest or maybe most noticeable jump in WordPress market share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also at the same time you had web 2.0, kind of take off in that same time period. So between the social between the boom and like the overall span of tech and I think this was when other competition from WordPress started to get a little further in the rear view mirror too. I think movable type was by this time period, probably.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fading in terms, I believe, I can\'t remember exactly when they changed their business model, but I believe it was early during this time period where you had this other, you had your choices in Joomla and Drupal were still very strong in this era, but they were becoming, [00:13:00] it was becoming the big three in terms of CMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As in, at that time they were all the top three, they were open source. So that\'s and WordCamps to exploded. I think once we got to 2012, 2013, that\'s when you saw a lot of first-time WordCamps, startup and WordCamp, I think by the time that WordCamp Miami got to its fourth or fifth year, that\'s when we had to start coordinating with other word camps, you know, around the same time period to make sure we didn\'t have the lap and all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, and we had buddy camps and we had our first kids camp, I think it was in 2015 or something like that. So by the time that happened, And I forget what WordCamp Arizona. I think I went to my first word camp in Arizona was working in Phoenix. I believe that was in 2013. Maybe. I don\'t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have to Google ice Luiz WordCamp and figure out what I\'m really. I know. So that was 2.0, from 2010 to 2018. So Bob, when, tell us about what transition from version 2.0 to [00:14:00] 3.0 and your blog posts made you land on 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> You know, I think it was, there was a lot of, I mean, it revolved around, but we\'re pressing was doing technically, I mean, you know, Gutenberg 5.0, all that stuff, because there was that huge shift at that point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that people just started, I don\'t know. The climate changed and how people looked at it. And there was a little bit more, you know, yeah, people were anti this or they were, you know, reluctant of this. And is this changing for the best? I feel like things were changing in WordPress that affected the community in a lot of ways positively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in some ways people were a little bit reluctant and things were starting to get more into that mix of at, you know, not the boom, like it is now with the acquisitions, but. We were starting to see, you know, let me explain it this way. And this is kind of a strange way to [00:15:00] explain it. Maybe people won\'t really get it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always say I used to work in the real business world and that was outside of WordPress. And I\'m, it\'s a little bit of sarcasm there, but it\'s how, you know, regular business works, how it runs, how, you know, people get acquired corporations, all that stuff. I\'ve dealt with it in the past. I felt like that was a time that WordPress matured and thus the community had to start to accept that in the sense of this is becoming big business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, you know, this is becoming a bigger thing then. Sure. It\'s open source still. There\'s that community there\'s everything that WordPress is, but now more and more people are taking note of WordPress more and more people are wanting to get into WordPress and it just. From the, around that time, I think it\'s just as grown more and more that attitude, the you know, and it is it\'s a [00:16:00] lot of people have pivoted or changed their mind on WordPress during that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you saw more of that, I think, and maybe it always was happening, but it was just vocalized more as far as, you know, oh, I don\'t like the direction it\'s going now or, you know, I don\'t agree with it. And the, and that was cool. That was fine. I mean, everybody\'s got a right to, you know, do that. And also the other thing I think is this was when you think of all those people that started in 2009, 2010, that really started, this might be the moment they start thinking of different transitions as well, because they\'ve been in it for a while and that transition may be do an acquisition. They may be getting out of the space entirely moving on with their life in another direction. However, so I think we saw that bunch of people that were so in our view and in our, you know, that we saw them a day [00:17:00] in and day out, maybe after, you know, this period of eight years or nine years or whatever, they were ready to start slipping things a little bit in their own business or how they approach WordPress or how they approach their business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Well, we\'re going to get into the community now more now that we know where, when we talk, we say version one, version two, version three, again, version one was from the beginning up to 2009 version. Two\'s kind of like 2010 to 2018 when Gutenberg was launched. And then version three is pretty much present quote unquote, present day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. And who knows we may talk about another version. We\'ll see what. I\'m going to open up our post status conversation we had in here, like a day or two ago too. But so let\'s talk about the community a little bit in terms of, and it sounds like to me, when you, when we, both of us are kind of old timers a little bit we\'re both remembering back when the businesses were just starting to get off the ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would you define version 3.0 [00:18:00] as, as basically more commercial,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> you know, in a sense it is, and it\'s probably viewed as more commercial because of the nature of open source. So bringing bigger businesses, bringing the model of, you know, business growth, acquisitions, how normal, I almost say normal, but how businesses in the real world that exists and how they.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get together and how they merge now. They, you know, whatever direction they go. I think it\'s become a little bit more commercial, but I don\'t know if that\'s the exact word it\'s because it\'s, I think some people would say that I really think they would define maybe that and they would define it in the sense of a negative connotation to that commercial is become too commercial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s kind of in the eyes of the viewer, you know, before, [00:19:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> let me play devil\'s advocate for a second, because once money gets involved, it\'s like, whenever it\'s, how do I explain this? Like, if I have a good friend, I, and if I have a laptop, I\'ll give him the laptop. I won\'t sell him the laptop. Why?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because he\'s my friend and I, if there\'s something goes wrong, I don\'t want anything to damage that relationship. So when money comes into the picture, closer relationships tend to get a little bit more complex in my experience. That\'s just my experience. So do you think part of the, and we\'ll get into the good old days slogan in a second here, but do you think part of the resistance or part of the, maybe just general uncomfortableness of this new version that you call it is because it is more commercial, therefore money, you know, money hiring acquisitions, all of that is together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So therefore when you go up and talk to someone at a WordCamp, or you don\'t, you know, you have to be careful what you say. You have to be careful of how you talk outside of a conference room. You [00:20:00] don\'t want to say the wrong thing or be viewed as this type of person, which makes it a little more awkward, which makes limits it a little bit of your freedom, which makes, again, goes back to you being a little bit more comfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you think that has anything to do with some people reactions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> You know, I think you, I think that\'s a. I think it\'s pretty spot on because it is it\'s, you know, there is that level of walking the thin line. Sometimes you don\'t want to, you know, you maybe felt you didn\'t have to walk that so much before you could be a little bit more open and now there\'s too many buyers that could ignite, I think the money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. When people see now, I don\'t remember ever back the valuation or what you would think of, you know, we don\'t know often what, how much these businesses are being bought for, but the reality is, yeah. Now we\'re seeing that there is some tied dollar value to these businesses that have done amazing stuff for, you know, close to a decade or less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:00] And yeah, that money kind of gets you like, whoa, you know, this is all feeling, not the same, you know, and it can be for some that it can be kind of a creepy feeling. You know, they feel like money is corporate and money is commercial and, you know, money talks and that\'s what drives everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, lots of people are doing their businesses and that what drives them is to actually make a Duff to survive and have a decent life</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> or because, or somebody on stage talking about a certain subject because they have some sort of financial gain indirectly, perhaps, but even there. So sometimes I feel like some people don\'t take, I\'m trying to find the right words here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I swear, I\'m not going to edit this part out because I want people to hear the awkwardness in this conversation. Exactly. It\'s well, that person is doing that or broadcasting that because they have a business to run or their business is doing this in the WordPress space. And you know, that.[00:22:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, that can be understandable in other industries, but for WordPress, I think it\'s kind of new if you\'ve been around it a long if you\'ve been in since version one or the early days since version two I don\'t know. I\'ve heard it. We\'ll talk about offhand comments in a little bit, but I pieced together some of the comments from Twitter, some things I hear over my shoulder word camps and, you know, and it\'s a very fine and respectable group still, but I know that, you know, I put on working at Miami for years and sometimes I get questions, like, why is this person on at this time?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes it\'s purely coincidental often it\'s purely coincidental, but I get asked, you have to be more conscious of that back now than you were 10 years ago. And because I think it all boils down to money and companies and expansion and all of that but, you know, and which kind of leads me to my next question for you, Bob, in terms of money, just, you know, even if you put money in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we\'re both community managers not just with not just with me with [00:23:00] WordCamps, but you know, w my, my, my daughter and my wife, they hold other communities and I\'ve seen communities grow over the years. I handle the local meetups along with a few other people too. I\'ve seen things grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m also, I here\'s a side note for you. I use apple pro I use apple products. I wouldn\'t consider myself an apple super fan, but I\'ve used apple products for a long time. Like since I was in high school. And I\'ve done PC and windows over the years, but I mainly, I\'ve mainly been an apple person, but I\'ve noticed through the years, even before the iPhone came about, this was way before the iPhone apple came out with the iPhone when they were almost a bankrupt company, I\'ve been with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I noticed over the past decade as the company has gotten bigger, and this happens with other companies too, but in particular with apple, my experience they\'ve gotten, people have gotten more outspoken. More bold in their comments and click baity to an opinionated and whether or not that some of that is based on truth and you know, apple like any other company is not perfect, but [00:24:00] it seems like the bigger you get, the more criticism gets thrown at you in, regardless of what I can\'t think of a company that has gotten bigger over, you know, given enough time over the last 10 years, it has not had criticism leveled at them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I feel that once you get to a certain size from a community standpoint, not really from a business company standpoint market share, but that obviously has a factor into it too. Once you get to, once a community gets to a certain size and grows and you start to see bad actors just because maybe it\'s the scale and it\'s, and maybe when it\'s smaller, they were always there, but there was just harder to see for them to blend into the mass.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, and we\'ll take this, we\'ll take this as an example, bad actors. What do you mean by bad actors? There\'s always people that want to scam other people or users and in when the WordPress was in version one very few times, have you saw people trying to scam other people? Because the community was so small, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The, it didn\'t seem to happen [00:25:00] very often. And in same thing for like apple and WordPress community, didn\'t seem to be a lot of people trying to take advantage of trying to steal this. And, you know, cause you know, windows was the big one durability. You want it to target cause a lot of people used it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, so here\'s my question for you. Do you believe that any community wants to reaches a certain size is going to have certain problems? Like not just bad actors that want to scan, but just critics that just maybe feel like they need to, they feel like their job is to probably call. Accompany once it gets to a certain size, what do you think about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Oh, I think that\'s right on, I mean, is it\'s so obvious because it\'s like success breeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t know if there\'s actually a saying, but success breeds craziness or something</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I\'m gonna use that quote</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> yeah. Yeah. Success breeds crazy days because it does, the more you become the bigger you become, the more of a tar more touch points you have and [00:26:00] you become that target. You do. And more people are going to be attracted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause there\'s some people that they live for, that they live for the big names or the, they want to be in the limelight in that community, but in a different limelight as a backnet bad actor, because that is it just, you know, Reproduces itself is going to, it\'s going to attract people and all it takes us, you know, a few to start it and more and more are going to enter it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s what know, I I\'ve thought over the years is this is growing into what probably every community does grow into. It\'s huge. How can we not avoid? I think of, I could step back to the time when I was, you know, not online. I was in a business community that was a real life community town.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as that town grew bigger and bigger, more businesses moved in and there were more that early. [00:27:00] That were running businesses and we\'d come in and they would always be there at whatever meeting or something criticizing something. So it\'s not anything new. I think it\'s very, I don\'t want, I hate to use the word natural, but I think there\'s no way around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think with growth, you\'re just going to, that\'s going to happen and you have to know, the best you can do is it\'s, you know, as, as long as we, and you don\'t want to ignore, but you don\'t want to, I want to fire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Right. And I want to make a good distinction here because not everything I say, negative things about WordPress all the time, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, I have created memes around certain things in WordPress. That\'s still annoying me to this very day. And you know, you know, like the number of admin notices on a dashboard has gotten me more likes on Twitter than I probably know what to do with. So. What, one of the natural things that comes when you, when your community grows is [00:28:00] that there is more to criticize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is, you know, it goes perfectly along with, yes, a lot of the criticism that\'s leveled against WordPress is legitimate. And everybody has different viewpoints in they\'re coming at it from certain angles. Somebody from this industry is obviously gonna feel stronger than someone who comes from this industry and so forth like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I just think that part of this, I think what has been a staple I\'ve I think in the version 3.0 is just the, has been maybe a little bit more cynicism than that I saw in the previous two versions. Exactly. Yeah. And as much, and like I told you, I think that comes with, I write that off as scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I said, when you\'re dealing with. In terms of like, you know, they were just a bunch of people, friendly people helping each other out on forums and all of that back in the day, just like we were like in the very early days of WordPress. And now there are so many people and because I guess a lot of people [00:29:00] have so much writing on WordPress too, that sometimes naturally it does come off as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If my entire business of my entire life is running off of WordPress or companies like automatic that in my mind influence WordPress to a certain degree, then I should be the one or I should be in a position to say what I want or be critical of this or that in terms of leadership and ownership and all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\'m not saying leadership and ownership, isn\'t a bad stuff in and of themselves, but it\'s not something that we saw in previous versions of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Right. And I think we also look at WordPress where it came along in the, in history. I mean, you know, short history, but we are, if you think of back from 2010 to now, how social has brought on the aspect of being able to vocalize yourself and it has brought out peoples that wouldn\'t normally, you know, you would, I mean, I could [00:30:00] look back at again, I\'ll go back to way back, you know, at a chamber of commerce meeting, we\'re all sitting around in person, nobody\'s going to jump up from different table to table say, Hey, you know, that business sure does suck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, you know, why are they doing that? Or why did they buy them? Why is this all going on now? We\'re to a point where we\'re all</p>\n\n\n\n<p>behind journalists,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>we all got an opinion. And we got to, we got a place to make that opinion. So that has grown just historically in technology. I mean, you know, that has happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that then right along with it, WordPress has grown. So it\'s almost like this. There are both on the same level. Yeah, more people are able to get online and say exactly how they feel are most people are not shy about doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what do you think here\'s a thinking question for your Bible. What do you think the WordPress community has today that it didn\'t have back in the early days?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boy, that\'s a, wow. That\'s a good question. I think there\'s [00:31:00] just more,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow. That\'s a tough one because I think it has okay to two things. One is it has more voices in it and I\'m not seeing voices as far as negative and positive and neutral voices. I\'m talking about voices, worldwide diversity countries, all the different cultures that are coming in. I think that. Really has changed things. And I think it\'s changed for the better obviously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And again, kind of historically, you know, hopefully getting where there\'s more, you know, things are a little bit more equal. I know they\'re far from being equal, but</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> yeah, there\'s a table, right. Everybody gets to come to the table and hopefully that table has grown in size with more chairs available to fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Exactly. Yeah. I think it\'s that. And I think innovation, I think is just, I think people feel, even though sometimes we feel that it\'s, there\'s so much stuff go, you know, there\'s so many plug-ins how can we do more [00:32:00] plugins? How can we do this? But again, naturally over time, I think we have a lot more at our disposal as far as.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be more innovative with WordPress then, you know, back then, and that again is not necessarily the word press or the community is just how technology has evolved. So I think we, I think WordPress benefits from the time it\'s in, because of everything that keeps turning and sure we there\'s changes. And maybe some we don\'t like, and some we do, like, I think, you know, in the end they\'re still all going in the right direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now those changes are technically within WordPress should hopefully reflect on the community and they feel like, okay, we\'re going in the right direction because we got to continue to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Okay. Was it, you said two things, was that both of them or do you remember?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> It\'s really, it\'s kind of that feel of the community and the [00:33:00] diversity and that, and then it\'s an actual, more of innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the technology now we have the, I really feel like the opportunities are. More open to everybody in the WordPress space, even though, you know, we think it may be overcrowded. I think there\'s still a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Okay. So here, I asked myself that same question in the shower for unluckily for me, it was a 45 minute shower cause I wasn\'t leaving until I got an answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the communication from the quote unquote, the source has gotten better over the years. Unless you heard Matt Mullenweg speak from a word camp or in his blog, sometimes you were a bit, a little bit confused in the very on maybe late version 1.0 early 2.0 days in terms of heck maybe even further on to 2.0 days, what was happening with the project or what was happening with the direction of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this was before Gutenberg. You know, there were improvements. You could talk to people on contribute, you know, charter contributors and all of that. And there were new [00:34:00] sites keeping up. But I think once we started getting into what you call the version three, once Gutenberg ramped up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think, especially, I think maybe I\'ll say six months, it seemed like six months after Gutenberg was launched. It seemed like the communication was improving. I think Josepha, I\'m not sure when she became, she took her role and Incorrectly state her role here, because I don\'t want to do that. But she is, she has acted like a director or a pro like an overall project manager.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m not saying that\'s her role, but she\'s been acting like that. She has been part of for a key part of the communication. Now for a while, in terms of trying to translate what the WordPress project is, the general direction of where it\'s going. And, you know, Matt did do that to a certain extent, but I don\'t think it was as often or as regular and as consistent as they\'re doing it now with the blog posts and Josepha, and there\'s even podcasts now with Josepha on them and so forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for me the communication and the openness about especially about [00:35:00] core is what we, I think we have today that really wasn\'t there too much in the early days, because there just wasn\'t enough time to talk about it. Now don\'t hate me. Oh, wait. There\'s a podcast is still young here. I\'m going to flip the question around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what do you think is missing today from the WordPress community? But one looks back in the early days and say, oh, wow, that existed there. Or I even missed that. Fill in the blank. I</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> need a long shower for that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> This is going to be weird. Intermission music, but sure, sure. So by, so maybe stalling you a little bit here, you know, when you buy a car and you get that new car smell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Okay. So it\'s gone and then your car can still be exciting. It can be wonderful. There\'s that honeymoon period. But what, and I\'m not pushing you into a negative or positive territory here, [00:36:00] but what do you think was existed in the early days that you can remember the works community that you don\'t see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That you don\'t see today as much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> I miss a little bit of the and that I want to say it\'s the warm and fuzzy feeling. Cause that\'s not fair to say. It\'s kind of a little bit of the tighter community that was there when I first got into it. And what I mean by that is, and let me give you an example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was very interesting and I get to bring up the, say the word smaller group. And I saw Matt Mullenweg in a different lens. At that event. He was walking around. I mean, it was a smaller group and he was really interacting with people and laughing. And he was kind of more in his element because he was with his eye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sounds weird with his peeps. I mean, instead of this huge, you know, multi hundred or a thousand person conference, and sometimes I [00:37:00] miss that. And it\'s not an exclusive thing either, but those smaller times, I go back to a meetup. I remember the meetups I used to do in Seattle in the early two thousands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\'d get like 70, 80 people and everybody was so happy and energized and it was fun. And you were meeting new people and there was this just constant energy that was going. And I think is just like probably anything in it\'s younger. I mean, even us as humans,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> every time you go to a WordCamp, you\'d meet a ton of new people, a ton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, you do. And I kind, kinda miss that and maybe it\'s, you know, it\'s just that smaller. I miss the meetups. Like they used to be. I, and I know that is just, I, and not even this put us COVID aside. It\'s not even that it\'s just that I miss that [00:38:00] smaller local community that used to thrive. I think a lot more, that\'s got segmented and it\'s been segmented just because of the growth and because of the community is so big.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there\'s so many people you\'re meeting, you know, another countries across the globe. There\'s a little bit of that I miss now, whether that could really come back. That\'s the thing, that\'s a big question. I don\'t know if it\'s really necessary to be needed, right. Again, but some I wish there was some way to still have those smaller groups and they don\'t have to be, you know, WordCamps on, I don\'t even know what they are, you know, and that would, of course would have to be, you know, when the time comes that you can actually do that, but there was something that was just a little bit different. That part of it, I miss, and I don\'t know there was there was the energy, maybe that was it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> It\'s kind of hard to put into words. You\'ve attempted to do that two days ago. I\'m going to share a link in the show notes for a slack conversation we [00:39:00] had. And I put up on purpose prior to this both Eric and Natalie said something about 2008, 2009, 2010. There was definitely. Definitely those were big years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was some generations based on what people came into the community and what they were doing there. And then you said something around 2010 or so was very generational. There was huge pivots in the space around space, around growth during that time. And then someone responded and says that time was very unique.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It felt like anyone with the ambition and drive could learn to create something special with WordPress. It wasn\'t something reserved for only a small group of corporations. And it looks like Eric made that comment there. So I guess it was you know, it was a gold rush period, but not just to make money, but also to make like relationships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here\'s the key when you said that earlier and forgive me if I\'m mispronouncing your name. Dave is David Lutes who says, yep. The hippie times are over. And it\'s not meant in a bad way. In my opinion, this is him still talking quote. It already has started a few years before Gutenberg, when more and [00:40:00] more sponsored contributors raised up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also people became paid from day one when they stepped brand new into the WordPress community. And like he said, it\'s not bad. It\'s an evolution. It\'s got all the way to it\'s. He says it\'s all got gotten. Translating here, all gotten too big to handle, and I have tremendous respect for the pure volunteers out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So hippie times are over or according to Dave loots here. And we\'ll put all of those links in the show notes. And by the way, just to remind you what you said, a response, you said you could be very well, right? The last decade could easily have pushed out three instead of two versions when you get down to the nitty gritty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah. Wow. Yeah. Hippie times are over. So like I\'m always never, I\'m not that old to appreciate the hippie times of the sixties, but I\'ve read about it enough and I can see where there was a time I\'ve heard that phrase repeated elsewhere in terms of, okay, the hippie era is over and now I actually have to have a real job and a real business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that whole time of peace and love was great, but we were young. And [00:41:00] do you think maybe that\'s part of what maybe is missing a little bit from WordPress</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> and it\'s that, yeah, it is that time of having that. It a freedom. I mean, and especially if you had the experience of it, you know, if you did, you were, you came in at some point there, it is nostalgic and I\'d love Dave\'s, everything you said in there because it\'s true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s like anything. I mean, hippie times never, you know, except for some people that are stuck being hippies for their entire life or something they\'re going to end at some point and they\'re nostalgic and they\'re good. And you probably know it, won\'t go back to that. You know, you know that in your heart, but</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> seems like the harder you fight it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. The change is inevitable. And I think for the rest of those, I think for the rest of the lifetime of WordPress, there\'s going to be a healthy dose of criticism that follows it. So w so as WordPress grows is going to be scrutinized by some people for how it grows [00:42:00] and when the market share stops. Or there\'s less contributions or something noticeable starts to slow down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'ll be another round of WordPress criticism problem. You know, like the apple is doomed or WordPress is doomed by probably those same people. Right. Do you think people should accept the generational changes in the WordPress community? Or how should they look at it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, I think it\'s really, I hate to say it\'s both ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, you got to accept it as globally. You got to accept that this is, you know, if he can\'t be a bit flux flexible, then you shouldn\'t be in any part of the tech space. You know, you got to have some flexibility and you\'ve got to not become the old grumpy man and saying, this is how it was and why we\'ll never be that way again, you know, so globally you need to accept it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In your own community, because how we\'re all defining communities is going to be different. How you define it. Maybe one way somebody else defines another way. Somebody may [00:43:00] have 200 people they think of as this is my WordPress community. You can still make changes within the smaller community that can blossom out into different ways into the bigger community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, you\'re not, you know, if we\'re talking WordPress community, every builder, then that\'s a lot, every builder and user, then that\'s an exponentially a lot. So I think that you can make small changes and I don\'t think you should ever say, I\'m just going to roll over. And you know, if I don\'t think this is right, you know, you don\'t have to nag and moan and groan on Twitter day after day, but you can fight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creative and useful ways to try to work towards, you know, if something really, if you think it needs to be changed, I would never say people should back down you know, unless it\'s really detrimental to the community, then that\'s maybe when you want to step back. Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I, a lot of times the, [00:44:00] if there are people that rubbed me a little bit, the wrong way and listen, it\'s be honest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, there are people that do that. It\'s human nature, right? It\'s not what they say is sometimes their approach to it. And I have a lot of experience sometimes working and talking with people because we\'re cam Miami has allowed me to be like, sometimes I would deliberately put people in WordCamp, Miami lineups to offer those opinions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And sometimes. It\'s just their personal nature. Sometimes it is you know, I, if I run a, if I wanted to write a tell all book, just on what I know about certain people on working in Miami, it would be controversial. A lot of people probably wouldn\'t like me, but that\'s fine. But there are some people that like, feel their message is so important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They, it boosts their ego or it boosts their, like, they feel like this message is so important. They need to get outside the lines to be able to tell it whether how effective that is or whether that strikes the right chords or not. I mean, go you do you, you know, that\'s not really my, you know, I\'m not in charge of WordPress messaging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you know, if you want to, if you [00:45:00] feel something so important that you communicate it, I mean, as long as you\'re not hurting others, I mean, feel free to give it a shot, just watch on any reaction or reaction to that. But it\'s also funny too, that some people, when we talk about the WordPress community, some people says I\'m leaving WordPress, I\'m leaving the WordPress committee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or they stop or stop using WordPress oftentimes in my experience, and this is over 10 years, this is not any particular case, but over the 10 years where people have said that you still see them on Twitter, or you still see them in the WordPress community, talking with the same people, almost like nothing ever happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I, and sometimes I think these people, whether the legitimate reasons or not you know, they\'re trying to make a statement. It says I\'m leaving WordPress, but they\'re not really leaving WordPress. WordPress is the community and of itself, regardless of like, maybe you\'re not using the software or you put your pretty much, nothing else has changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you\'re using it to make a statement, whether you\'re using WordPress or not, congratulations, you\'ve made. Or maybe you\'re taking a break, you know, those people that make the big announcements, I\'m taking a break from Twitter and they\'re making a big hoo ha about it. Like maybe celebrities or something like [00:46:00] that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you\'re like, okay, maybe you\'ll be back. Okay. You know, once, once it\'s died down or whatever, but I think some people like to have their cake and eat it too, where like, I\'m making this big statement, but I can\'t really, I don\'t really want to leave the community because there\'s some good things in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> exactly. And I think they\'re trying to stand up there. They think that, you know, it gives a, it shows the side of their strength. They want everybody to think that, oh yeah, they\'ve been there standing up for what they\'re really, you know, they\'ve kind of walking the talk. Finally, they\'d been saying all this, but then like you said, you see, oh yeah, they\'re still wandering around bed in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still see them popping up here and there. And it\'s like, you know, you\'re just. Kind of toned down a little bit maybe,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> and you know what that is within the right to there. Like I said, however you want to get that message out is however you do. But I just think that\'s so interesting that the community of it itself is more, is stronger sometimes than the software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Oh, it is. It is. And I think that\'s what most, I [00:47:00] agree with you with a lot of people saying, you know, oh I\'m going to leave the community, but you know, I couldn\'t quite leave this part of it or this part of it. And they\'re not saying they\'re not literally saying that, but they\'re doing that through actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see that they\'ve gained a lot of great relationships with some people and they can\'t let go of that. And that relationship in turn still connects him with WordPress. So they, and connects them with the community. So, yeah it\'s interesting human. Nature\'s</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> interesting. Yeah. And of course there\'s always legitimate reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like if there\'s, if you like, you\'ve people have felt like legitimately they\'ve been neglected, abused, all of that stuff. That\'s not really taking care of that part cause that\'s kind of a toll different, totally different ballgame. So yeah. So do you feel, so here comes, our, here comes as we close out this conversation, which has been fantastic by the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we only mentioned WooCommerce only a few times. I haven\'t said it enough for something like WooCommerce to appear in a mirror or something like that [00:48:00] instead of three times, probably yet. But here\'s the two remaining questions I wanted to jam with you about one. What do you think version four would be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Has it happened? Is it happening now or do you think we\'re not, we haven\'t seen that yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> You know, that\'s weird because I know you had warned me that you might ask about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And I have pondered on it a bit and I thought, you know, yeah, maybe I could have some, a wishlist of what I\'d like to see, but you know, I think it\'s going to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where this commercial part we\'ve talked about, becomes a little bit more leveled out. I think four is where we don\'t get all excited and, you know, acquisitions no longer are like the biggest news in WordPress. They Almaz say they become everyday normal things and people will still talk about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think those moves that we\'ve been [00:49:00] making to where we see that it\'s becoming a bigger thing. And I also see that 4.0 is, and it\'s already, maybe it is already happening. I see a lot of attraction even more so I\'m more visibly from outside. Businesses, you know, that say, I want a piece of WordPress. I want a piece of WooCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, I get this a lot through conversations and companies that reach out to me, you know, they want to get in on it. They want to get in on the action. So that\'s almost like an, and however people view that, you know, that they view that as positive or negative is not really the point that, but I think that is becoming people are companies are being a bit more visible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think this will be part of 4.0 is in their interest in WordPress where it used to be WordPress is [00:50:00] open source and you know, it\'s not that big of a deal and stuff. And now it\'s like, they\'re flat out saying, Hey, we want in, how do we get in? We want to be, because</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> it\'s like we said, it\'s a little hot about the money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Once you see these aquifers, I think, you know, like once you start seeing bigger acquisitions, they\'re taking headlights now in tech crunch, all these other things, people are starting to, I guess, pay attention. Oh wow. There is money to be made here. So I\'m yeah. I mean, I want to I, wouldn\'t thinking about the same thing and I don\'t have a year in mind yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, if I did, I\'d probably play the lottery or something, but what I see are four potential factors for version four, if you want to call it that, and maybe they all are playing. One, I think we\'re in, I think we\'re version three still includes the acquisitions craze that we\'re going through right now, because I think the acquisitions, if you look back a little bit far enough after Gutenberg, I think launched. To me, it just seemed a lot more common.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s really exploded the last couple of years. I don\'t think it\'s over, but I still think we\'re in the same general [00:51:00] time period acquisitions were happening before Gutenberg came out, but I think Gutenberg probably has triggered a lot of companies, smaller companies for, to be acquired by hosting companies and others because of the blocks, the themes and all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, we\'re not even going to talk about theme, you know, WordPress themes at all, or we\'re not even about WooCommerce or e-commerce, I\'m not even going to talk about that stuff cause that\'s too much. But I think if I was to guess what a version four would be, and this is commute, this it\'s sad because I\'m not talking much about the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m just thinking of the, community\'s going to react to these things. And that becomes version for the community outside investments. How we react to that outside investments might mean more people coming in from the outside, even if it\'s just from a business standpoint, but they would be part of the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think too, it\'s possible than an aversion for maybe near the end of that. We will see acquisitions, maybe become normal, more normal. But I think we\'re also going to see market share eventually [00:52:00] level off. And that could be years from now. It\'s going to be hard to calculate it because they\'re shutting down Alexa, not that Alexa, the other Alexa next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we don\'t know exactly how we\'re going to be able to determine them at the market share metric because we\'ve kind of taken advantage and abuse it over the years. But I tend to see a general acquisitions being more of the norm market share, not as explosive as it used to be, because quite it\'s kind of like apple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s kind of, again, I go back to apple, they were selling iPhones one year. That would, their total sales of iPhones for one year would be all of the sales for the previous years combined. And they had that kind of explosive growth. Then it stopped because you couldn\'t sell that many phones anymore. But look at them today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'re doing just fine. They\'re doing just fine. So I think that\'s going to be the way with WordPress. We\'re going to see market share slowed down because quite far, I mean, whether it gets to 50% or not, I don\'t care. It could be beyond that. It could be years from now, but eventually the market share has to slow down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I\'ll ask you a [00:53:00] question about market share in a second. I think acquisitions nor market share slows down. We\'re going to get more, you know, outside investments. We\'ll see those. And then I think matt\'s master plan. Maybe I\'m not sure what you would call this his plan of an open web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you looked at the acquisitions and I\'m not sure if you had the read the piece by David Pierce yet on ma on mat, it was a click baity title. It was can Matt Mullenweg save the internet if you haven\'t read it because it basically folk you would think, oh, it\'s a piece about Matt WordPress and yes it is, but it goes along also the acquisitions automatic has taken over the past couple of years and individually by themselves were like, oh, that\'s neat. They have this little thing. But if you add them together, Matt is slowly accumulating like a collection of these technologies and these corners of the internet that I think needs to be maintained as open, like a diary app and a photos on creative commons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there\'s analytics, statistics company that they acquired that I can\'t remember the name of, but it\'s like, he\'s collecting almost one of each or automatic is collecting one of each of [00:54:00] everything. And I think that is going to change. Maybe it\'s making the community more open source minded than WordPress minded maybe, but I think there\'s a cat there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s going to be some change. There may be an, a version four, maybe a version five. However you want to split it where we\'re going to see, like we\'re going to be so more fighting for the open source or the open web. And WordPress is just going to be part of that. In fact, I think didn\'t Matt say that Gutenberg is going to be bigger than WordPress. Yeah. Yeah. That\'s a state of the word. So if I had to guess that\'s my version for, I don\'t know, that\'s it. And the</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> only other thing I\'d add, and this is more around the people side of things. I\'m really curious that by version four, if we will have a bigger turnover in who you really notice in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, we got all these people that I\'ve, you know, kind of are the faces we\'ve been around forever. We\'ve seen them, is there going to be a new generation and a kind of influx of newer [00:55:00] people stepping up and taking over the roles in the bigger WordPress community. And some of the other people that have been in a while might be at that point in time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And maybe again, we can\'t get 4.0 will start, but will they be stepping back and maybe doing other things with their lives? And it\'ll be this. This whole new kind of, even though each one has been a generation in its own, that might be a more pivotable generation. That with, when you look at the kids and what your kids are doing, I mean, what so many of them are doing that they could come in and just, you know, barnstormed the place and ,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>, but you see it, like how many P how many original people of the original tech companies are still around Microsoft?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No bill gates has gone even his can\'t remember his name now developers, guy has gone. The original owners are starters of Google aren\'t there anymore. All of in fact, I think an apple of course, has a leader. They\'ll probably transition like, like the only person left is Zuckerberg is still a [00:56:00] Facebook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone else has had one or two leadership changes. Very recently, Jack is no longer Twitter. So we\'re seeing that, but also in the WordPress space you know, the advanced custom fields, Sandhill development these people that have been like the starters from day one, they\'re moving on, whether they\'re moving on retiring or they\'re moving on to other projects or other companies through acquisitions is up for debate or whether it\'s, they\'re doing, but we\'re seeing the same thing happen in the global tech community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So exactly. So, yeah, I, wow. This has been a really deep conversation about community, but I didn\'t think, but it was all because of your all because of your blog posts really. And that\'s really</p>\n\n\n\n<p>right. I wrote it and I wrote the, I titled it in a question because I thought, okay, this is just a little snap, a snapshot in my brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I want people to think about this and I love that you did this. And I loved hearing on slack and hopefully, you know, this might. Inspire some some blog posts, cause I\'d love to hear other ideas and stuff. [00:57:00] So, so, it did its job and that, that\'s what I wanted it to do. Get people thinking about</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> it. I know I\'ve taken too much of your time already talking about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s like, what else am I going to do? And we got to go out and do, let me direct you to one last thing earlier today, because I don\'t plan enough far enough in advance for half of our conversations. I put up a Twitter poll and that\'s going to run for another two days. So, while we\'ve been talking about here, strangely enough, we\'ve had at least 10 people vote on it and it\'s only been.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three or four hours since I put the vote up has been over 40 votes on it so far, but for a Twitter poll for me, that\'s on a new year\'s Eve. That\'s pretty good. So I asked based on your post, where do people feel they belong in terms of what WordPress generation and I we\'ve listed the version one version two, version three, and then whatever, if there\'s other than replying, the comments nobody\'s replied other yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they pick one or two or three. So after 41 votes, let\'s see, just making sure I got my numbers, right. [00:58:00] 41 votes. So 39% responded version one. This is 36% version two. So that\'s 2010 from 2018 and 24% said two to 2018 and above for version three. Interesting. So it\'s, you know, it\'s only 40 votes if it was more evenly split between thirds the last time I saw it, but you are getting a little bit more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A slightly older people are older versions. Yeah. So I just thought that was interesting. We\'ll link to this in the in the show notes as well. So by the time you hear this recording, this poll would have ended long ago. It should be interesting to see what it ends up being. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s fantastic. Was there anything else that we didn\'t cover about that post that you think we should have?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> No, I think we, we dove into a deep, yeah, we</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> killed, we deep dive and killed it, buried it. We used every part of the Buffalo. Yeah. Bobby could be</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> and now, everybody else can chime in and create their own posts and create their own tweets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And [00:59:00] then talk about this. Yeah. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> You know, besides Bob, other than my wife, you\'re the only adult I\'ve spoken to in the last couple of days. Anyway. So maybe it\'s nice to have a good conversation. We don\'t have WordCamps anymore. This is the type of conversations I\'d love to have. Right at word camps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it\'s the parts that, that I miss the most, but we can still do them up to this point. And I\'m looking forward to that time where you and I can sit together and talking you know what? Version three is coming to a close, or maybe we\'ll say it probably a year after it\'s happened. Cause you know, retrospect is Einstein sights, 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, Bob tell us where people can find you or version two, but on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Okay. I\'m version two. Best place I hang out a lot of on Twitter, you can either @BobWP or @dothewoo depending on what you want to do. Bob wp.com is I\'ve kind of revived that blog. I took all the WooCommerce stuff off and I\'m basically just talking about community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So these kinds of little thoughts come to me and that\'s what I\'m going to be putting there. And if you want [01:00:00] to, you know, again, woo commerce do the blue dot on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Okay, great. Yeah, and like I said, check the show notes for this episode. We will throw Bob\'s link to his blog post in there, specifically this Twitter poll that I did and a few other tidbits as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob, it has been awesome. Thank you very much for sharing all this thoughts with us. And I really hope this at least brings a couple of ideas and thoughts into people\'s heads, not just ones that have come into the WordPress community recently, but also the ones that have been around with it since version one, maybe, or version two, we\'ll see where the poll ends up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Cool.

The team is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2022/01/10/proposal-mandatory-safety-measures-for-in-person-wordpress-events-in-2022/\">proposing additional measures</a> previously not required.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, in-person attendees are required to be fully vaccinated, recently tested negative, or recently recovered from COVID-19. Every one of these requirements is vague and open to multiple interpretations. Recent spikes in infection in both vaccinated and unvaccinated populations has caused the Community Team to propose the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Mandatory masks for all attendees (even in regions that do not have a mask mandate at this time).&nbsp;</li><li>More prominent messaging in&nbsp;WordCamp&nbsp;websites, emails, and social media posts about COVID-19 safety guidelines.</li><li>Mandatory temperature checks for all attendees at the event (if permitted by local authorities).</li><li>Accessible hand sanitizing stations in the venue.</li><li>Maintaining social distancing practices during the event (Larger meeting rooms and seating arrangements with good spacing can be a good way to implement this).</li><li>Having a plan for contact tracing measures in case of infections (can be done using WordCamp registration data,&nbsp;meetups&nbsp;are a bit tricker).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the concerns with imposing more mandatory safety measures is enforcement. WordPress events are generally hosted by volunteers who would now need to go beyond simply facilitating an event to being ready to confront and remove those who don&#8217;t comply with safety protocols. In a community of people with diverse convictions, what happens if some members decide that WordCamp is a good place to protest pandemic restrictions? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I appreciate very much the heart behind wanting to keep the community safe, but have significant issue with how this is being proposed, and how it would be enforced, and how it shifts the burden of health and safety to a volunteer team of organizers who are not in any way trained or equipped to handle making medical decisions,&#8221; Ben Meredith said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Further, there are many jurisdictions where the proposed changes (like a mask mandate) are specifically prohibited by local law or executive order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Trying to make a policy from the international level (WordCamp central) that applies fairly and equitably to all local jurisdictions is a fool’s errand. What works in Los Angeles probably wont in Louisiana or Lagos. That’s why organizers are local.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the WordPress community is fixed on hosting events at this time, then there are many more responsibilities organizers are now obligated to assume in order to ensure the safety of attendees. Participants in the discussion on the proposal raised dozens of questions about how these new safety measures might be implemented. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;On temp checks, if someone reads high ( they may not even be aware) would we then refund their ticket to the event assuming we are talking a WordCamp?&#8221; Laura Byrne asked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> WordCamp organizer and speaker David Ryan raised questions about masks, will the requirements outline what qualifies as a mask? (<em>&#8220;Does a plastic face shield qualify as a mask? Are masks with ventilation valves acceptable? A bandana?&#8221;</em>) Does the requirement include speakers while they are speaking? &#8220;This should be clear in advance for both speakers and attendees to make informed choices without surprises day-of,&#8221; Ryan said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also asked if the masking policies extend to other venues, such as the official event hotel and after parties, the way the Code of Conduct applies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Refunds are another consideration. Will WordCamps refund people who test positive right before the event? Will the event refund if people arrive and are not comfortable or are asked to leave for not complying with the safety measures?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In addition to these proposed guidelines, I also recommend that we remove our existing guideline of allowing recent-recovered community members from attending a WordPress event <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/28-11-2021-update-on-omicron\">since new COVID variants like Omicron are known to cause reinfection</a>,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored WordPress Community Wrangler Hari Shanker said in the proposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura Byrne urged the Community Team to clearly define this guideline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are in for a boatload of trouble with the word &#8216;recent,\'&#8221; Byrn said. &#8220;In other words, something along the lines of, &#8216;anyone who has tested positive for COVID may not attend a WordPress event until X days after they are no longer testing positive.\'&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some participants in the discussion see the additional safety measures as an overreach for WordPress events. It&#8217;s easier and more straightforward to recommend organizers stick with local requirements for anything related to health safety. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Surely I’m not the only one thinking that the foundation shouldn’t be setting health guidelines at all?&#8221; Cameron Jones said. &#8220;Compliance with local regulations should be the only requirement.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with this is that many locations and regions do not have any kind of precautions in place, due to political differences, or are slow in recognizing emerging threats. Lax local guidelines for large gatherings may leave the WordPress community vulnerable to outbreaks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As a WordCamp organizer and speaker, and more personally as a recent cancer survivor and immunocompromised person, State of the Word was a troubling event to observe,&#8221; David Ryan said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Local legal requirements were met, but not proven event practices that eliminated or greatly-reduced positivity rate at larger gatherings in 2021 compared to the results of SOTW (namely, masks and testing). Planning, day-of and response afterwards didn’t inspire confidence this community was prepared to run safer and inclusive events — so this is an encouraging step towards remedying concerns many have expressed.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comments on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2022/01/10/proposal-mandatory-safety-measures-for-in-person-wordpress-events-in-2022/\">proposal</a> are open until January 22, 2022.

Despite this, it has become the standard for modifying the look and feel of a website. Developers have become comfortable with the API. Users have grown accustomed to adjusting colors, fonts, and even internal WordPress options through it. However, it will disappear for many once a block theme is activated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I began writing this post on the upcoming block-based theme system and site editor. However, I spent so much time explaining the customizer changes that I thought it best to focus on that aspect to let users know their options if they run into a snag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also a follow-up to a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/ask-the-bartender-what-happens-to-the-customizer-when-a-block-theme-is-active\">post I published in October 2021</a> on the same subject. Since then, some things have changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.9 will launch with several of the final components of Full Site Editing. The centerpiece of these features will be a new theme system, which allows themers to build designs entirely out of blocks. Once such a theme is active, users can edit their site&#8217;s front end via the site editor and global styles system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The site editor is, essentially, the next iteration of what the customizer aimed to do. The difference is that users can now customize every aspect of their site&#8217;s front-end and not just configure the options their theme author made available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many block theme users, the disappearance of the customizer will be a non-issue. However, three missing options have no exact equivalent:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A partial site icon (favicon) solution exists but not for every scenario.</li><li>The custom CSS box is not available.</li><li>There is no draft process before switching to block theme.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically, the customizer is available via <code>/wp-admin/customize.php</code>. Even though no links to it are shown in the admin, any user with the requisite permissions can access it via that URL. At the very least, the first two issues can be mitigated by editing options in this way. It is not ideal, but it will work in a pinch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Site Logo block has a &#8220;use as site icon&#8221; option. This is a quick and easy way to update the logo and favicon via the new site editor, assuming they use the same image.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />New “Use as site icon” option.\n\n\n\n<p>If they are different images or if the user does not use a logo, the only built-in way to change the site icon directly is through the <code>customize.php</code> URL trick mentioned above. The Site Logo block also adds a link to the customizer option.  Users can also opt for one of the dozens of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/favicon/\">favicon plugins</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A custom CSS solution in core WordPress is unlikely to be reimplemented in the site editor. The global styles panel and per-block design options are the future of styling. This makes many of the most common stylistic tasks much easier for non-coders. In the context of block-based themes, the average user is unlikely to need the CSS editor in the customizer.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom CSS section in the customizer.\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are situations where custom CSS is necessary. Again, the easy answer is to access <code>customize.php</code> once again. For a more dedicated solution, there are <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/custom+css/\">numerous plugins available</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is currently no solution for live previewing and customizing inactive block themes. With classic ones, users can test customizations before activation. In the customizer, block themes will appear with a warning message.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Theme details with warning about customizer support.\n\n\n\n<p>Once a block theme is activated from the customizer, WordPress will return the user to the Appearance &gt; Themes page in the admin. They can then modify their site via the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this can be problematic for some sites. Just about any theme change will mean there is at least some customization work in order, and most people will not want their visitors to see an unfinished site. Working from a dev or staging site before migrating the changes is ideal. However, that option is not always available or even easy to figure out for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another solution is to install a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/maintenance+mode/\">maintenance-mode plugin</a> if working on a live site. This way, visitors will at least know some changes are happening under the hood and that they can return later. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an open ticket for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/37201\">previewing and editing</a> inactive block themes. As ticket creator Anton Vlasenko wrote as the proposed solution, &#8220;It&#8217;s simple: we need to implement that feature.&#8221;  In the long term, this is a must-have feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is one situation where the customizer will still be accessible via the admin menu and toolbar. WordPress will <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35877\">automatically detect</a> when a plugin or theme hooks into the customizer and make links to it available.  I like to think that my first post covering block themes and the customizer <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/30496#issuecomment-948276503\">raised awareness</a> of this issue. At the very least, we now have a fix in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assuming there are no other changes in the next two weeks, this is how the customizer will function when paired with an active block theme.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 00:22:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:138:\"Gutenberg Times: Gutenberg Changelog #58 – Gutenberg 12.2 and 12.3, WordPress 5.9 RC and DevNotes for Full-Site Editing and Block Themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?post_type=podcast&p=19982\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-58-devnotes-for-full-site-editing/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8312:\"<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack and Grzegorz Ziolkowski  talk about WordPress 5.9 release and DevNotes for Full-site Editing and block themes, and  Gutenberg 12.2 and 12.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Music:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/xirclebox\">Homer Gaines</a></li><li>Editor:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandy-reed/\">Sandy Reed</a></li><li>Logo:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://markuraine.com/\">Mark Uraine</a></li><li>Production:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://paulisystems.net/wordpress-consulting\">Pauli Systems</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-58-devnotes-for-full-site-editing#shownotes\">Show Notes </a>/ <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-58-devnotes-for-full-site-editing#transcript\">Transcript</a></p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-19982\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Subscribe to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/\">Gutenberg Changelog</a>&nbsp;podcast via your favorite podcast apps!</strong><br />🎙️&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/620NwVKQJGdTupy36zYxvg?mc_cid=4b6c9f88fe\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9ndXRlbmJlcmd0aW1lcy5jb20vZmVlZC9wb2RjYXN0\">Google</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/gutenberg-changelog/id1469294475\">iTunes</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pca.st/podcast/f8445ec0-7508-0137-f267-1d245fc5f9cf\">PocketCasts</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/show/gutenberg-changelog\">Stitcher</a>&nbsp;|<br />🎙️&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/chi7j-9904a/Gutenberg-Changelog-Podcast\">Pod Bean</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://castbox.fm/channel/Gutenberg-Changelog-id2173375\">CastBox</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/gutenberg-changelog-878239/\">Podchaser</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/podcast\">RSS Feed</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\" id=\"shownotes\"><strong>Show Notes </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"listener-questions\">Listener Questions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jessicalyschik\">Jessica Lyschik</a> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jessicalyschik/status/1478785283889971200\">Question tweeted</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"paragraph-block-add-font-family-support\"><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/37586\">[Paragraph Block] add font family support</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/adityakane\">Aditya Kane</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Jessica and Aditya for your great questions!</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">If you have questions about Gutenberg, Block Themes or Full-site Editing, email us changelog@gutenbergtimes.com or DM on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gutenbergtimes\">@gutenbergtimes</a> or WP Slack. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"state-of-the-word-videos-and-q-as\">State of the Word Videos and Q &amp;

If you are a designer, or theme developer it might be interesting for you, and you might have an opinion how submissions should be curated on the official WordPress repository. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of the WordPress repository, <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/m_munirkamal\">Munir Kamal</a> </strong>created his idea of a Theme directory via the Gutenberg Hub: <a href=\"https://gutenberghub.com/re-imagined-wordpress-themes-directory/\"><strong>Re-Imagined WordPress themes directory</strong></a>. I really like the way how themes details on color schema, typography, and block styles can be surfaced to a Theme directory page. Kamal was right when he wrote: &#8220;This makes it much easier to find the theme that’s right for you without having to download and test multiple themes.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Justin Tadlock</strong> at the WPTavern also took a look and wrote: &#8220;In the dawn of the block theme era, the WordPress theme directory could use a reimagining.&#8221; <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-hub-launches-a-block-based-wordpress-theme-directory\">The rest of the article is ready for your purusal</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/carolinapoena\">Carolina Nymark</a>,</strong> write and developer on Fullsiteediting.com has a tutorial for you on <a href=\"https://fullsiteediting.com/lessons/creating-block-templates-for-custom-post-types/\"><strong>how to use a php template to create a block template for Custom Post Type</strong></a>. Given how often I see the question on what about Custom Post Types, this is a very timely tutorial for Theme Developers. Nymark wrote: &#8220;The main pain point is that people are expecting to be able to create this type of template via the new&nbsp;<strong>Site Editor</strong>&nbsp;interface. This is a reasonable expectation, unfortunately&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/37407\">the feature is not complete yet</a>&nbsp;and not included in WordPress 5.9.0.&#8221;.

The start was a bit wonky with some audio issues that cleared up at the timestamp 14:32. The next session will be next week, Thursday at 10:30 am ET / 15:30 UTC</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>On January 12th, <strong>Daisy Olsen</strong> and <strong>Sarah Snow</strong> present the first installment of another series: &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/wordpress-social-learning/events/283103474\"><strong>Zero to Block Theme Series: Foundations&#8221;</strong></a> at 1pm ET / 18:00 UTC. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan</strong>, core contributor on the meta team,  takes you along her journey while <a href=\"https://ryelle.codes/2021/12/switching-to-a-block-based-theme\"><strong>switching to a block based theme</strong></a>. She shares with you her process and her challenges and how she overcame them. Choyce-Dwan also surfaced a few things that are bugs and some have already been fixed. She also noticed that there is no way to give buttons or links hover state/colors, and CSS is your fallback. In conclusion, she wrote: &#8220;It was a fun experiment to refresh this site, and I really see the promise of block-based themes for easy site building. It’s a new framework to get used to, and sure there are bumps to work through, but it’s going to be great.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"tools-for-site-builders-and-content-creators\">Tools for Site Builders and content creators</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In her latest YouTube video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5fbGuTdPKw\"><strong>Connecting The Dots: Level up with Query Loop</strong></a> block, <strong>Anne McCarthy</strong> is showing off a real-world example of the Query Loop block, and she demonstrates how it saves her time. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In his review <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/anariel-design-releases-bricksy-its-third-wordpress-block-theme\"><strong>Anariel Design Releases Bricksy, Its Third WordPress Block Theme</strong></a>, Justin Tadlock gives Ana Segota, designer at Anariel Designs, and her theme high marks on beauty and versatility.

The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/markup-markdown/\"><strong>MarkUp MarkDown</strong></a> plugin seems to change that although it gives me unwanted flashback to pre-block editor times. In his review, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-plugin-offers-a-markdown-editor-solution\"><strong>New WordPress Plugin Offers a Markdown Editor Solution</strong></a> Justin Tadlock, is of other opinion, so it was a worth a read for me. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of Flashback, read <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/a-throwback-to-the-past-retro-winamp-block\"><strong>A Throwback to the Past: Retro Winamp Block</strong></a> by <strong>Justin Tadlock</strong> on his take on the block plugin that allows you to embed a Winamp player and skin into your 21st-century website.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/phil_webs\">Phil Webster</a></strong> created the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/a-throwback-to-the-past-retro-winamp-block\"><strong>Newspaper Column </strong></a>block, and interesting approach to have this block automatically display text  over three or four columns automatically. It works best with paragraph and lists. Webster also plans to work on Accessible Block Collection to offer additional accessibility features for core blocks and build blocks that are missing for instance an Accordion block.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a sidenote, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phil_webs/status/1479242474304552960\">here</a> is a twitter exchange with Webster about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phil_webs/status/1479242474304552960\">what is best for the user: Single purpose blocks or bock collections.</a> What has been the better experience been for you?

Dit is meer dan slecht een nieuw standaard thema. Het is een nieuwe manier van werken met WordPress thema&#8217;s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blok thema&#8217;s geven veel mogelijkheden voor visuele aanpassingen. Van kleurschema&#8217;s en lettertype combinaties tot pagina templates en afbeeldingsfilters. Dit allemaal vanuit de site bewerkingsinterface. Door wijzigingen op één plek te maken kun je Twenty Twenty Two dezelfde lay-out geven als je merk of als andere websites. Of je kunt met je site een totaal andere kant opgaan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Het Twenty Twenty‑Two thema is al beschikbaar voor jou. Het is gelijktijdig met WordPress 5.9, geïnstalleerd en je kunt het vinden bij&nbsp;<a href=\"https://devries.frl/wp-admin/themes.php\">de overige geïnstalleerde thema&#8217;s</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"jouw-persoonlijke-paintbox-wacht\">Jouw persoonlijke paintbox wacht</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/5.9/navigation-block.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Meer blokthema&#8217;s die geschikt zijn voor volledig site bewerken zijn, net zoals het Twenty Twenty‑Two thema, beschikbaar in de Thema Directory. Ze wachten om ontdekt te worden, meer komen er snel!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wanneer je enkele van deze nieuwe thema&#8217;s gebruikt hoef je niet langer de Customizer te gebruiken. Alle kracht van lay-out aanpassingen zit in de Site Editor. Net zoals je ziet Twenty Twenty‑Two bouw jij je site met de look en feel aan de hand van de beschikbare tools. Deze tools hebben een eenvoudige interface die praktisch to leven komen in je handen.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/5.9/global-styles.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"navigatieblok\">Navigatieblok</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Blokken komen naar de site navigatie, het hart van gebruikerservaring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Het nieuwe navigatieblok geeft je de mogelijkheid om te kiezen: een responsive menu wat altijd aan staat of één die zich aanpast naar de schermgrootte. Wat je ook creëert, weet dat het er is om te hergebruiken waar je ook wilt zoals bijvoorbeeld in een nieuw template of na het wisselen van thema.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\" id=\"meer-verbeteringen-en-updates\">Meer verbeteringen en updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Hou jij ervan om te bloggen of om inhoud te creëren?

Ook heb je meer controle over details zoals spacing, randen en veel meer zodat je niet alleen het uiterlijk kan aanpassen, maar de kleine details kan polijsten.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"de-kracht-van-patronen\">De kracht van patronen</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/5.9/pattern-explorer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"-317\" height=\"-238\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>De WordPress Pattern Directory is de basis voor een grote verscheidenheid aan blokpatronen die zijn gebouwd om tijd te besparen en extra functionaliteit te bieden. Nu kun je ze bewerken en zien of ze passen. Iets anders nodig in de header of footer van je thema? Verander deze eenvoudig met enkele klikken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>De patroonverkenner maakt het mogelijk om patronen te vergelijken en kiest diegene die je gebruikers verwachten. Dit alles binnen een bijna volledige schermweergave die je elke details laat zien.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/5.9/list-view.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"-397\" height=\"-298\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"een-vernieuwde-lijstweergave\">Een vernieuwde lijstweergave</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 5.9 stelt de lijstweergave je in staat om je inhoud te verslepen precies waar je het wilt. Beheren van complexe documenten is ook makkelijker; eenvoudige controls laten je secties uit- en inklappen terwijl je je site bouwt — en voegen HTML ankers aan je blokken toe om gebruikers op weg te helpen op de pagina.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"verbeterde-galerij-blok\">Verbeterde galerij blok</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Elke afbeelding in de galerij hetzelfde behandelen zoals het ook gebeurd in het afbeeldingsblok.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elke afbeelding in je galerij anders vormgeven (bijsnijden, duotonen, enz.) of ze allemaal hetzelfde maken.

Deze nieuwe templates zijn gedefinieerd in HTML en maken gebruik van aangepaste styling via theme.json.

Deze gedeelde styles kunnen worden gebruikt in meerdere blokken of in een individuele style waardoor ze alleen maar daar gebruikt worden.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/12/15/using-multiple-stylesheets-per-block/\">Gebruik maken van meerdere stylesheets in blokken</a>&nbsp;bevat meer informatie.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h3 id=\"block-level-vergrendeling\">Block-level vergrendeling</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Het is nu mogelijk om elk blok (of enkele) in een patroon op te vergrendelen, gewoon door het lock atribuut op te nemen in de settings van blocks.json. De rest van het patroon blijft vrij voor site editors om het in te passen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"herontwikkelde-galerij-blok\">Herontwikkelde galerij-blok</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>De veranderingen aan de galerij blok zijn een resultaat van een bijna afgeronde refactoring.

Nu kun je blokken toevoegen, zowel in widget gebieden op je site als met live preview via de Customizer. Dit opent nieuwe mogelijkheden om inhoud te maken: van mini-lay-outs zonder code tot de enorme bibliotheek met core blokken en blokken van derden. Voor onze ontwikkelaars, je kunt meer details vinden in de&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/29/block-based-widgets-editor-in-wordpress-5-8/\">Widgets dev-note</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/5.8/about-query-loop.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"457\" height=\"362\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Berichten tonen met nieuwe blokken en patronen</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Het Query Loop blok maakt het mogelijk om berichten weer te geven op basis van gespecificeerde parameters; zoals een PHP loop zonder de code. Toon eenvoudig berichten uit een bepaalde categorie, om dingen te doen zoals een portfolio of een pagina vol met je favoriete recepten. Zie het als een complexer en krachtiger nieuwste berichten blok! Plus, patroon suggesties maken het makkelijker dan ooit om een lijst van berichten te maken met het ontwerp dat jij wilt.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/5.8/about-template.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"461\" height=\"300\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bewerk de templates rondom berichten</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Je kunt de vertrouwde blok-editor gebruiken om templates te bewerken die je inhoud bevatten: activeer eenvoudig een blokthema of een thema dat zich heeft aangemeld voor deze functie. Schakel over van het bewerken van je berichten naar het bewerken van je pagina&#8217;s en weer terug, allemaal met behulp van een vertrouwde blok-editor. Er zijn meer dan 20 nieuwe blokken beschikbaar binnen compatibele thema&#8217;s.

Naarmate blokken toenemen, patronen ontstaan en het maken van inhoud gemakkelijker wordt, zijn nieuwe oplossingen nodig om complexe inhoud gemakkelijk te navigeren. Lijstweergave is de beste manier om tussen lagen met inhoud en geneste blokken te springen. Omdat de lijstweergave je een overzicht geeft van alle blokken in je inhoud, kun je nu snel navigeren naar het exacte blok dat je nodig hebt. Klaar om je volledig te focussen op je inhoud? Schakel het in of uit om aan je workflow te voldoen.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/5.8/about-pattern-suggestions.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"-266\" height=\"-144\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Voorgestelde patronen voor blokken</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Vanaf deze release stelt het gereedschap Patroon transformaties blokpatronen voor op basis van het blok dat je gebruikt. Op dit moment kun je het proberen in het query-blok en het social pictogram blok. Naarmate er meer patronen worden toegevoegd, kun je inspiratie opdoen voor het stijlen van je site zonder ooit de editor te verlaten!</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/5.8/about-duotone.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"-238\" height=\"-194\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stijl en kleur afbeeldingen</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Je afbeelding en omslag blokken kleuren met duotone filters! Duotone kan een vleugje kleur toevoegen aan je ontwerpen en stijl je afbeeldingen (of video&#8217;s in het omslag blok) om goed te integreren met je thema&#8217;s. Je kunt het duotone-effect zien als een zwart-witfilter, maar in plaats van dat de schaduwen zwart zijn en de markeringen wit, kies je je eigen kleuren voor de schaduwen en markeringen.

Dat betekent dat zoekmachines grotere afbeelding voorbeelden kunnen tonen, wat je verkeer kan stimuleren (maar niet als de site is gemarkeerd als&nbsp;<em>niet-openbaar</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Doorlopende schoonmaak na de update naar jQuery 3.5.1</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>JQuery heeft jarenlang geholpen om dingen op het scherm te laten bewegen op manieren die de basistools niet konden, maar dat blijft veranderen, en dat geldt ook voor jQuery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 5.7 wordt jQuery meer gefocust en minder opdringerig, met minder berichten in de console.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lazy-load je iframes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Het is nu eenvoudig om iframes ook lazy-load te laden. Standaard voegt WordPress het&nbsp;<code>loading=\"lazy\"</code>&nbsp;attribuut toe aan iframe tags wanneer zowel breedte als hoogte zijn opgegeven.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h3>Bekijk de Field Guide voor meer informatie!</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bekijk de nieuwste versie van de WordPress Field Guide.

Alles is hetzelfde als voorheen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Template voor toegankelijkheidsverklaring</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Zelfs als je geen expert bent, kun je mensen met een klik op de knop laten weten dat je site zich inzet voor toegankelijkheid! De nieuwe&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/10degrees/accessibility-statement-plugin\">functie plugin</a>&nbsp;bevat een template kopie die je kan updaten en publiceren, en het is geschreven om verschillende contexten en rechtsgebieden te ondersteunen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ingebouwde patronen</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Als je nog niet de kans hebt gehad om met blokpatronen te spelen, hebben alle standaardthema&#8217;s nu een reeks blokpatronen waarmee je complexe lay-outs met minimale inspanning onder de knie kunt krijgen. Pas de patronen naar wens aan met de tekst, afbeeldingen en kleuren die bij je verhaal of merk passen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Voor ontwikkelaars</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>REST API authenticatie met applicatie wachtwoorden</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dankzij de nieuwe autorisatiefunctie voor Application Passwords van de API kunnen apps van derden naadloos en veilig verbinding maken met je site. Met deze nieuwe REST API functie kan je zien welke apps verbinding maken met je site en bepalen wat ze doen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Meer ondersteuning voor PHP 8</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>5.6 markeert de eerste stappen in de richting van WordPress Core ondersteuning voor PHP 8. Dit is een goed moment om te plannen hoe je WordPress producten, diensten en sites de nieuwste PHP-versie kunnen ondersteunen.

De technische term is &#8216;lazy-loading&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Op mobiel kan lazy-loading ervoor zorgen dat browsers geen bestanden downloaden die bedoeld zijn voor andere apparaten. Dat bespaart je lezers kosten voor datagebruik en helpt de levensduur van de batterij te verlengen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Zoeken</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Verwelkom je nieuwe sitemap.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress sites werken goed met zoekmachines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.5 bevat nu standaard een XML-sitemap, die zoekmachines helpt je meest belangrijke pagina&#8217;s te vinden vanaf het moment je live gaat met je site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Daardoor vinden meer mensen je site, en dat geeft je meer tijd om ze te boeien, om ze vast te houden en om ze te converteren naar abonnee, klant, of hoe jij succes ook definieert</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Beveiliging</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Auto-updates voor plugins en thema&#8217;s</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je kan nu in de WordPress-admin instellen dat plugins en thema&#8217;s automatisch worden geüpdatet — of niet natuurlijk! Zo weet je zeker dat je site altijd de meest recente code draait.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je kan auto-updates in- of uitschakelen voor elke plugin of elk thema die je hebt geïnstalleerd — alles op dezelfde schermen zoals je gewend bent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bijwerken door het uploaden van ZIP bestanden</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Als handmatig updaten van plugins en thema&#8217;s je ding is, dan is dat nu ook eenvoudiger — simpel door een ZIP bestand uploaden.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hoogtepunten van de blok-editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wederom zit de laatste release van WordPress bomvol spannende nieuwe functies voor de blok-editor. Bijvoorbeeld:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Blokpatronen</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nieuwe blokpatronen maken het simpel en leuk om prachtige, complexe lay-outs te maken door gebruik te maken van een combinatie van tekst en media om je verhaal te vertellen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je vindt blokpatronen ook in een uitgebreid aanbod aan plugins en thema&#8217;s, en er worden continue nieuwe toegevoegd. Kies ze vanuit een enkele locatie — gewoon klikken en gaan!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Er zijn verschillende blok lay-outs in dit tabblad. Na het scrollen door opties, waaronder knoppen en kolommen, wordt een patroon gekozen genaamd &#8220;Grote header met een header&#8221;. Dit voegt een cover blok toe, dat is aangepast met een foto en de naam van de WordPress 5.5 jazzmuzikant.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h3>Inline afbeelding bewerking</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Vanuit het afbeeldingsblok kan je nu meteen je foto&#8217;s bijsnijden, roteren en inzoomen. Als je veel tijd besteedt aan afbeeldingen, dan kan dit je uren besparen!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>De nieuwe blok bibliotheek</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Het is nu makkelijker dan ooit om het blok te vinden wat je nodig hebt. De nieuwe blok bibliotheek is in de blok-editor gebouwd, zodat je nieuwe bloktypes kunt installeren voor je site zonder de editor te verlaten.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>En zo veel meer.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>De hoogtepunten hierboven zijn maar een klein gedeelte van de nieuwe mogelijkheden van de blok-editor die je net hebt geïnstalleerd. Open de blok-editor en geniet ervan!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Toegankelijkheid</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Iedere release voegt verbeteringen toe aan de toegankelijke publicatie ervaring, en dat geldt ook voor WordPress 5.5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nu kun je links kopiëren in mediaschermen en modale dialogen met een knop, in plaats van te proberen een regel tekst te markeren.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je kan ook metaboxen verplaatsen met je toetsenbord, en afbeeldingen in WordPress bewerken met je ondersteunende apparaat, omdat het de instructies in de afbeeldingseditor kan lezen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Voor ontwikkelaars</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.5 komt ook met een grote hoeveelheid wijzigingen alleen voor ontwikkelaars.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Server-side geregistreerde blokken in de REST API</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Het toevoegen van endpoints voor bloktypes betekent dat JavaScript apps (zoals de blok-editor) definities op kunnen halen voor alle blokken die zijn geregistreerd op de server.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Dashicons</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>De Dashicons bibliotheek heeft zijn laatste update gekregen in 5.5. Het voegt 39 blok-editor pictogrammen toe samen met 26 andere.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Definieer omgevingen</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress heeft de manier waarop het type omgeving van je site (staging, productie, etc) wordt gedefinieerd gestandaardiseerd. Haal dat type op met&nbsp;<code>wp_get_environment_type()</code>&nbsp;en voer alleen de daarvoor bedoelde code uit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Gegevens doorgeven aan template bestanden</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>De template-laadfuncties (<code>get_header()</code>,&nbsp;<code>get_template_part()</code>, etc.) hebben een nieuw&nbsp;<code>$args</code>-argument. Je kan vanaf nu een hele array aan data meegeven aan deze templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Meer wijzigingen voor ontwikkelaars</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>De PHPMailer bibliotheek heeft een grote update gehad, van versie 5.2.27 naar 6.1.6.</li><li>Krijg preciezere controle over&nbsp;<code>redirect_guess_404_permalink()</code>.</li><li>Sites die gebruik maken van PHP&#8217;s OPcache hebben een betrouwbaardere cache-invalidatie dankzij de nieuwe&nbsp;<code>wp_opcache_invalidate()</code>-functie tijdens updates (ook van plugins en thema&#8217;s).</li><li>Extra berichttypen die aan de categorie-taxonomie zijn gekoppeld, kunnen nu via opt-in de standaardterm te ondersteunen.</li><li>Standaardtermen kunnen nu worden gespecificeerd voor aangepaste taxonomieën in&nbsp;<code>register_taxonomy()</code>.</li><li>De REST-API ondersteunt nu officieel het specificeren van standaard metadata waarden via&nbsp;<code>register_meta()</code>.</li><li>Je krijgt bijgewerkte versies van de volgende gebundelde libraries: SimplePie, Twemoji, Masonry, imagesLoaded, getID3, Moment.js, and clipboard.js.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bekijk de Field Guide voor meer informatie!</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Er is nog veel meer voor ontwikkelaars om van te houden in WordPress 5.5.

Meer manieren om je bezoekers binnen te halen en betrokken te houden met de rijkdom van ingesloten media van het web&#8217;s top diensten.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meer manieren om jouw visie echt te make. Zet blokken op de perfect plek neer. Zelfs als het specifieke blok nieuw voor je is. Meer efficiëntere processen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En meer snelheid in heel veel andere opties. Bijvoorbeeld in het maken van groepen of gallerijen. Je kunt zoveel sneller werken nu!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Twee nieuwe blokken. En betere blokken in het algemeen.</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Twee gloednieuwe blokken: Sociale iconen en knoppen maken het toevoegen van interactieve functies snel en gemakkelijk.</li><li>Meer opties met kleuren: gradients in de knoppen en cover blok, toolbar toegang to kleur opties in de tekstblokken, en voor het eerst nu, kleur opties in de Groep en Kolom blokken.</li><li>Je hoeft een stuk minder te gokken! Versie 5.4 stroomlijnt het hele proces voor het plaatsen en vervangen van multimedia in elk blok. Nu werkt het op dezelfde manier in bijna elk blok!</li><li>Als je ooit hebt gedacht dat je afbeelding in het Media+Tekst blok zou moeten linken naar wat anders zou, misschien zou de foto van een brochure bijvoorbeeld de brochure zelf moeten downloaden als een document? Vanaf nu kan dat.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Strakkere UI, duidelijkere navigatie en eenvoudiger met tab doorheen te navigeren!</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Duidelijkere blok navigatie met blok-kruimelpad. En een eenvoudigere selectie eens je daar bent.</li><li>Voor wanneer je moet navigeren met het toetsenbord, beter met tabben werken en focus. Plus, je kunt met tab naar de sidebar navigeren van bijna elk blok.</li><li>Snelheid! 14% sneller laden van de editor en 51% sneller om te kunnen typen!</li><li>Tips zijn verdwenen. Maar in plaats daarvan hebben we een Welkom Gids scherm die je tevoorschijn kunt toveren. Zo vaak je maar wilt.</li><li>Zie direct of je in de wijzig- of navigatiemodus van een blok zit. Of, wanneer je beperkt zicht hebt zal je screenreader je vertellen in welke modus je zit.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Als je met de allerlaatste tools en mogelijkheden wilt werken, installeer dan de <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">Gutenberg plugin</a>. Je bent dan één van de eersten die met nieuwe en interessante mogelijkheden in de blok editor werkt!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Je fundamentele recht: privacy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.4 helpt je met een aantal verschillende wereldwijde privacy punten. Dus wanneer je gebruikers en andere belanghebbenden vragen hebben over naleving van de regelgeving, of hoe je team omgaat met gebruikersdata, dan zou je nu het antwoord een stuk eenvoudiger juist moeten kunnen krijgen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neem een kijkje:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Persoonlijke data exports zijn nu inclusief informatie over gebruikerssessies en gebruikers locatie data van de community evenementen widget. Plus, een overzichtstabel.</li><li>Zie de voortgang van export en verwijderverzoeken via de privacy tools.</li><li>Aanvullend, kleine verbeteringen waardoor de Privacy Tools er net even wat strakker uit zien.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Speciaal voor ontwikkelaars</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Voeg custom fields toe aan menu-items&#8211;standaard</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Twee nieuwe acties maken het je mogelijk om custom fields aan het menu toe te voegen. Zonder aparte plugin en zonder maatwerk code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Op het Menu admin scherm, wordt <code>wp_nav_menu_item_custom_fields</code>&nbsp;uitgevoerd net voor de verschuifknoppen van een navigatie menu item in de menu editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In de Customizer,&nbsp;<code>wp_nav_menu_item_custom_fields_customize_template</code>&nbsp;wordt uitgevoerd aan het eind van de menu onderdelen form-fields template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check je code en bekijk of deze nieuwe acties jouw code kunnen vervangen. Als je bezorgt bent voor duplicatie, voeg dan een WordPress versiespecifieke check toe.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Blokken! Eenvoudiger vormgeving, nieuwe API&#8217;s en insluitingen.</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Blokvormgeving is <strong>drastisch</strong> vereenvoudigd. Negatieve margins en standaard padding zijn verdwenen! Je kunt blokken nu vormgeven zoals je wenst. Ook zijn vier onnodige wrapper div&#8217;s opgeschoond.</li><li>Als je plugins ontwikkelt, dan kun je nu verzamelingen van je blokken registeren via de namespace over verschillende categorieën.

Deze verbeterde stijlen lossen veel toegankelijkheidsproblemen op: kleurcontrast op formuliervelden en knoppen, consistentie tussen editor- en admin-interfaces, nieuwe notificaties, standaardisatie naar het standaard WordPress-kleurenschema en de introductie van animatie om interactie met je blokken snel en natuurlijk aan te laten voelen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voor mensen die een toetsenbord gebruiken om door het dashboard te navigeren, heeft de blokeditor nu ook een navigatiemodus.

Stel je inhoud in op breed of volledige uitlijning voor dynamische en boeiende lay-outs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty Twenty heeft, zoals het hoort, een sterke focus op overzichtbaarheid en leesbaarheid. Het thema bevat het typeface&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rsms.me/inter/\">Inter</a>&nbsp;wat ontworpen is door Rasmus Andersson. Inter is beschikbaar als een Variable Font versie, voor het eerst in een standaard thema, wat maakt dat de laadtijd kort houd door alle stijlen van Inter in slechts twee font bestanden beschikbaar zijn.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Verbeteringen voor iedereen</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Automatische afbeeldingsrotatie</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Je afbeeldingen zullen nu op de correcte manier gedraaid zijn wanneer je ze uploadt gebaseerd op de orientatiedata. Deze verbetering is negen jaar geleden voorgesteld en mogelijk gemaakt door het doorzettingsvermogen van vele volhardende bijdragers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sitediagnose controles</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>De verbeteringen die geïntroduceerd worden in 5.3 maken het zelfs makkelijker om problemen te detecteren. Uitgebreide aanbevelingen brengen lichten bepaalde onderdelen uit die aandacht nodig hebben in het Health Check scherm.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Admin e-mail verificatie</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Je wordt nu periodiek gevraagd om je admin email adres te bevestigen wanneer je ingelogd bent als een administrator. Dit maakt de kans een stuk kleiner dat je niet meer in je site kunt komen wanneer je je email adres wijzigt.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Voor ontwikkelaars</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Date/Time component verbeteringen</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ontwikkelaars kunnen nu werken met&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/09/23/date-time-improvements-wp-5-3/\">data en tijdzones</a>&nbsp;in een betrouwbaardere manier. Datum en tijd functionaliteit heeft een aantal nieuwe API functies toegevoegd gekregen voor unified timezone retrieval en PHP interoperability en daarnaast zijn er ook een hoop bug fixes doorgevoerd.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>PHP 7.4 compatibiliteit</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.3 ondersteunt PHP 7.4 volledig. Deze release bevat&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/10/11/wordpress-and-php-7-4/\">meerdere wijzigingen</a>&nbsp;die verouderde functionaliteit verwijderen en de compatibiliteit verzekeren.

Indien dit het geval is zal WordPress je niet toestaan de plugin te activeren.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-1027\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h3>Snelheidsverbeteringen voor de editor</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/5.1/editor-performance.svg\" alt=\"\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>De nieuwe blok editor die in WordPress 5.0 is geïntroduceerd is verder verbeterd. De grootste verbetering is de snelheid waarmee de editor nu werkt in WordPress 5.1. De editor zou nu iets sneller moeten opstarten en typen zou vloeiender moeten voelen. Los daarvan, in de komende versies zullen er meer snelheidsverbeteringen doorgevoerd worden.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hier worden ontwikkelaars blij van</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>Multisite metagegevens</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>5.1 introduceert een nieuwe databasetabel om metadata op te slaan die geassocieerd is met sites en het mogelijk maakt om arbitraire site data op te slaan die relevant kan zijn in een multisite / netwerkcontext.	<br><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/01/28/multisite-support-for-site-metadata-in-5-1/\">Lees meer.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Cron API</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>De Cron API is bijgewerkt met nieuwe functies voor returning data en bevat ook nieuwe filters voor het aanpassen van de cron storage. Andere wijzigingen hebben effect op cron spawning op servers die FastCGI en PHP-FPM versions 7.0.16 en daarboven draaien.	<br><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/01/09/cron-improvements-with-php-fpm-in-wordpress-5-1/\">Lees meer.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Nieuw JS Build Proces</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.1 introduceert een nieuw JavaScript build optie als gevolg van de grote reorganizatie van code die begon met de 5.0 release. <br><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/05/16/preparing-wordpress-for-a-javascript-future-part-1-build-step-and-folder-reorganization/\">Lees meer.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Overige fijne zaken voor ontwikkelaars</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Verschillende verbeteringen zoals updates voor de waarden die je kunt gebruiken in in de&nbsp;<code>WP_DEBUG_LOG</code>&nbsp;constant, een nieuwe test config file constant in de test suite, nieuwe plugin action hooks, short-circuit filters voor&nbsp;<code>wp_unique_post_slug()</code>&nbsp;en&nbsp;<code>WP_User_Query</code>&nbsp;en&nbsp;<code>count_users()</code>, een nieuwe&nbsp;<code>human_readable_duration</code>&nbsp;functie, verbeterde taxonomy metabox opschoning, gelimiteerde&nbsp;<code>LIKE</code>&nbsp;support voor meta keys wanneer je&nbsp;<code>WP_Meta_Query</code>&nbsp;gebruikt en een nieuwe “doing it wrong” melding wanneer je REST API endpoints registreert, en nog veel meer!	<br><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/01/23/miscellaneous-developer-focused-changes-in-5-1/\">Lees meer.</a></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://nl.wordpress.org/2019/02/22/wordpress-5-1-is-vrijgegeven/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"\n		\n		\n					\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n					\n			\n		\n		\n\n\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:8:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"WordPress 5.0 is vrijgegeven\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://nl.wordpress.org/2018/12/07/wordpress-5-0-is-vrijgegeven/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://nl.wordpress.org/2018/12/07/wordpress-5-0-is-vrijgegeven/#respond\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Dec 2018 10:11:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://nl.wordpress.org/?p=1004\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:371:\"WordPress 5.0 is vrijgegeven.

Wat het wel doet, is het jou mogelijk maken elke multimedia soort super eenvoudig toe te voegen precies zoals jij dat voor ogen hebt. Elk stukje content is een afgebakend blok welke je eenvoudig kunt verplaatsen. Mocht je liever met HTML en CSS willen werken, dan staan de blokken je niet in de weg. WordPress is hier om het proces eenvoudiger te maken, niet het resultaat.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/5.0/videos/add-block.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We hebben standaard al heel veel blokken beschikbaar, en elke dag worden er meer toegevoegd door de community. Begin een nieuw blok door de forward slash in te typen. Je krijgt dan direct te zien welke blokken er allemaal beschikbaar zijn.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vrijheid om te bouwen, vrijheid om te schrijven</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Deze nieuwe editor ervaring behandelt design en content op meer consistente manier. Wanneer je klantensites maakt kun je herbruikbare blokken maken. Hiermee kunnen je klanten steeds nieuwe content blijven toevoegen en blijft de uitstraling precies zoals je die bedoeld had.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/5.0/videos/build.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>Een verbluffend nieuw standaard thema</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/5.0/twenty%20nineteen/twenty-nineteen.webp\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>De front-end van Twenty Nineteen aan de linkerkant en hoe het er uit ziet in de editor aan de rechterkant.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>De introductie van Twenty Nineteen, het nieuwe standaard thema welke de kracht van de nieuwe editor laat zien.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ontworpen voor de Blok-editor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty Nineteen bevat aangepaste styling voor de blokken die standaard beschikbaar zijn in 5.0. Het thema maakt uitgebreid gebruik van editor-styles. Op die manier is wat je in de editor aan het maken bent een reflectie van hoe het op de site zelf er uit ziet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Eenvoudige, tekst gedreven lay-out</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty Nineteen bevat veel witruimte en moderne schreefloze koppen, gecombineerd met klassieke serif-tekst. Het thema gebruikt systeemlettertypes om de laadsnelheid te verhogen. Niet meer lang wachten op trage netwerken!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/5.0/twenty%20nineteen/twenty-nineteen-versatile.gif\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Veelzijdig ontwerp voor alle sites</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty Nineteen is ontworpen om te werken voor een breed scala aan toepassingen. Of je nu een foto-blog hebt, een nieuw bedrijf start of een non-profitorganisatie, Twenty Nineteen is flexibel genoeg om aan al je wensen te voldoen.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>Hier worden ontwikkelaars blij van</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Beschermen</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Blokken bieden een fijne manier voor gebruikers om content direct te wijzigen en ze voorkomen dat de structuur van de content niet eenvoudig kan worden gestoord door onopzettelijke codebewerkingen. Dit staat de ontwikkelaar toe om controle te hebben op de output door gepolijste en semantische markup te leveren die bewaard blijft tijdens het bewerken.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Opstellen</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Profiteer van een grote verzameling aan API&#8217;s en interface-componenten om eenvoudig blokken met een intuïtieve besturing voor je klanten te maken. Gebruik maken van deze componenten versnelt niet alleen het ontwikkelingswerk, maar biedt ook een consistentere, bruikbare en toegankelijke interface voor alle gebruikers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Maak</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Het nieuwe blokkenparadigma opent diverse mogelijkheden en verbeelding of hoe gebruikerswensen opgelost kunnen worden. Met eenduidige flow voor het toevoegen van een blok is eenvoudiger voor gebruikers om blokken te vinden voor alle soorten content. Ontwikkelaars kunnen zich richten op hun visie om verrijkte ervaringen te bieden, in plaats van werken met ingewikkelde API&#8217;s. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/\">Leren hoe je moet starten</a></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>Liever Klassiek?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/5.0/classic/Classic.webp\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Blijf je liever met de vertrouwde Klassieke editor werken? Dat is geen probleem! Ondersteuning voor de Klassieke editor plugin blijft aanwezig in WordPress tot en met 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>De <a href=\"https://nl.wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">Klassieke editor</a> plugin herstelt de vorige WordPress editor en het &#8220;bericht bewerken&#8221; scherm. Hiermee kan je plugins blijven gebruiken die de klassieke editor uitbreiden, klassieke metaboxes toevoegen of op een andere manier afhankelijk zijn van de vorige editor. Bezoek de plugins pagina en klik de “Nu installeren” knop naast &#8220;Klassieke editor&#8221; om de plugin te installeren. Wanneer de plugin klaar is met installeren, klik op “Activeren”. Dat is alles!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opmerking voor gebruikers van computerhulpmiddelen: als je problemen met de bruikbaarheid ervaart met de Blok-editor, raden we je aan gebruik te maken van de Klassieke editor.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://nl.wordpress.org/2018/12/07/wordpress-5-0-is-vrijgegeven/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:4:\"href\";s:35:\"https://nl.wordpress.org/news/feed/\";s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:44:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\";a:2:{s:12:\"updatePeriod\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"\n	hourly	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:15:\"updateFrequency\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"\n	1	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 11:45:49 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:34:\"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8\";s:6:\"x-olaf\";s:3:\"⛄\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 06:49:47 GMT\";s:4:\"link\";s:61:\"<https://nl.wordpress.org/wp-json/>; rel=\"https://api.w.org/\"\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 2\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20220126021455\";}', 'no'),

This is more than just a new default theme. It’s a brand-new way to work with WordPress themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/block-themes/\">Block themes</a> put a wide array of visual choices directly in your hands, from color schemes and font combinations to page templates and image filters, all from the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/site-editor/\">Site Editor</a>. So in one place, you can give Twenty Twenty-Two the same look and feel as your organization’s other materials—or take your site’s look in another direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You already have the Twenty Twenty-Two theme—it came installed with WordPress 5.9. You will find it with your other installed themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"474\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?resize=632%2C474&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12102\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"your-personal-paintbox-awaits\">Your personal paintbox awaits</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty Twenty-Two is not the only theme built for full site editing. More block themes are in the Themes directory, and the number will grow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you use any of those new themes, you no longer need the Customizer. Instead, you have all the power of the Styles interface inside the Site Editor. Just as in Twenty Twenty-Two, you build your site’s look and feel there, with the tools you need for the job in a fluid interface that practically comes alive in your hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"474\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?resize=632%2C474&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12103\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"the-navigation-block\">The Navigation block</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Blocks come to site navigation, the heart of user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Navigation block gives you the power to choose: an always-on responsive menu or one that adapts to your user’s screen size.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday marked three years since the WordPress project welcomed me as their executive director. As I start my fourth year, I&#8217;ve spent a bit of time considering what the next five years will bring us. WordPress will turn 19 this year, which means that we will soon be a whopping 20 years old; for some of the people who have been with the project since the beginning, that can represent two-thirds of their whole life. And even if you were not that young when you got here, two decades as an open source project is really a cause for celebration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not in that group that has been here forever. I showed up for the first time in 2009, as a community organizer, self-sponsored, and I learned so much about myself as a person and as a leader while I was doing that. So when I arrived as a sponsored contributor in 2015, I already knew exactly what made this work so fulfilling for me was these three things:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, the ability to lend a hand in those moments where I wish someone had lent a hand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second is the delight of seeing people&#8217;s first successes and the joy of watching them grow over time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:48</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third was a chance to be part of something great, which turned out to be something greater; greater than me or you or a CMS.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This list is still at the heart of what I feel I get out of the WordPress project. But it has also grown substantially in my seven years as a sponsored contributor. I now also love how we as a community of contributors get to foster a better way to lead and a better way to collaborate. And through those things help people find a way to have a better life. Not just through WordPress, the CMS, but through WordPress, the people, and WordPress, the project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so when I think of what I want for WordPress in its 19th year, so that we can head with confidence and dignity into our 20th year, it is this:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want you to remember that you are not alone here. People come together in the world often because of a shared location. But WordPress fosters this beautiful experience of bringing us together because of what we care about. Whether you care about PHP standards, diversity in technology, helping people with their first big wins, making WordPress more secure. I mean, if what you care about is being able to write the most arcane and complex apps on top of WordPress that the world has ever seen. Then there are others out there who want to do that with you, too. We have so many things to connect about. And fortunately, we support a great piece of software for getting our thoughts out in the world. Take some time to see who else shares your thoughts and potentially learn a bit about the view from the other side.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of the other side, I also want us to approach our discussions as the US versus the Problem TM. WordPress may be 20 years old, and we may stand on the shoulders of giants, but right now, the people who are here you, you are explorers and creators and guides toward the best possible future for WordPress. The tension that we witness between teams is always about the best possible answers for the people who use our software. It is about securing the freedoms of the open web for everyone who comes after us whether they know they need those freedoms or not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, I want us to expand our reasons for doing this at all. If you are a member of the community of contributors, We frequently talk about how we give back because WordPress gave to us. Or if you are part of a Five for the Future group. You have heard that companies who have experienced success because of WordPress should commit 5% of their resources back to the project to ensure WordPress&#8217; long-term success. But the reason that I keep doing this, and hopefully a new reason for you to keep doing this is that we can take part in securing opportunities for future users of WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I want WordPress to be the best CMS. Yes, I want this community to be vibrant and engaged. Yes, I want WordPress to be a shining beacon of how to work remotely. And I want all of that because I know it is our careful and tireless stewardship of this project that lets us continue to lend a hand in those moments where people wish for someone to lend a hand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are my hopes for WordPress in 2022 to move us forward into WordPress of the future. I hope you all will come with me and we can continue our journey together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks again for listening. I&#8217;m Josepha Haden and this is the WP Briefing. See you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12043\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"WordPress 5.9 RC 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/01/wordpress-5-9-rc-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 20:43:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"5.9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"RC2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12014\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:117:\"The second Release Candidate (RC2) for WordPress 5.9 is available!

His fascination with development and learning continued to grow, and he now makes a living using WordPress and the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on to discover his story, which shows with creativity and determination you can create products and make a living using WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"starting-web-building-on-a-phone\"><strong>Starting web building on a phone</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"350\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/12/collins-agbonghama1.jpg?resize=350%2C426&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Collins Agbonghama headshot photo\" class=\"wp-image-11920\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/12/collins-agbonghama1.jpg?w=350&amp;ssl=1 350w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/12/collins-agbonghama1.jpg?resize=246%2C300&amp;ssl=1 246w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins began his exploration of the internet while attending Secondary School in Nigeria, or High School as it is known in some other countries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A friend at the school had a simple mobile phone which could browse the internet. Collins had his first introduction to the World Wide Web through access to this device. He became hooked by reading headlines on a sports site about a famous English Premier League Football Club, Chelsea, a soccer team which he has long supported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Being a very inquisitive person, I wanted to learn how the web works as well as have my own website. I was able to buy a classic mobile phone through the menial jobs I did after school,” he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His first website was a wapsite or Wireless Application Protocol site optimized for mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He took to Google to learn how to actually build a site. He discovered he needed something called an ‘email address’ to sign-up for site builders. Google Search came to the rescue again, and he created the first email account for his first website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A desire for a website was the catalyst for further learning, starting with HTML and CSS from an online provider. His interest in building sites with more advanced tools grew, and then he came across WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using his savings, he bought the cheapest hosting plan from a local Nigerian web host. He installed WordPress and started writing tutorials for a mobile device platform. He built the site, created the lessons, and started his entry into WordPress all on a mobile phone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This led to him having the confidence to start building sites for others, and he was able to earn a small income from that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins said: “I couldn’t go to the university because of my precarious financial situation. I continued to do menial jobs during the day and started learning PHP in the evenings and at night using my mobile phone via online learning platforms.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was later able to get an old laptop, which helped him access ebooks to learn more and practice his coding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keen to share this learning, he started blogging about what he was learning on his website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins said: “I later took up a job teaching children at a school primarily because I got tired of the menial jobs and wanted to earn enough to take care of my internet data plan. After a while, I became fairly proficient in PHP and even took up a job to build a school management system.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"using-wordpress-to-make-a-living\"><strong>Using WordPress to make a living</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins’ blog wasn’t making money through advertisements, but he discovered opportunities to write tutorials for other platforms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I started writing PHP and WordPress development tutorials and got paid a few hundred dollars per article. In Nigeria, that’s quite a lot of money. I was able to improve the life and wellbeing of my family and myself,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After getting into a higher education program to study computer science, his life dramatically changed. He decided to stop writing and began to focus on building and selling WordPress plugins.&nbsp;His first one was a user and profile plugin for WordPress sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Thankfully, after a year, it started making enough revenue for me to live pretty comfortably here in Nigeria because the cost of living here is relatively low,” he said</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Collins has several plugins which have given him a sustainable source of income. He’s also a Core and Translation volunteer contributor to the WordPress.org Open Source project. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>I am thankful for WordPress because without it, I’m really not sure I would have been able to live a decent quality life. <br>Who knows what would have become of me?</p><cite>Collins Agbonghama</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“I am also thankful for the community. I have made lots of friends that have been very supportive and helpful in my journey.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “I tell people, life won’t give you what you want. You demand from life what you want. You make these demands by being determined and never giving up on your dreams and aspirations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If you are poor, perhaps because you came from a humble and poor background, it is not your fault. You can’t go back in time to change things. I implore you to be strong, determined, and work hard.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Meet more WordPress community members in our <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"contributors\">Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Michael Geheren (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/geheren/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>geheren</a>), Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>), for writing this feature, to @MeherBala (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>meher</a>) for follow-ups and photo-editing, and to Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>) and Nalini Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>) for the final proofing.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project. Some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, ages and ages ago, when I first started this podcast, someone basically requested that Matt and I do a duet for the last podcast of the year. A Christmas carol duet; him on the saxophone and me on voice. I obviously did not get that coordinated I don&#8217;t even know why I said obviously. I&#8217;ll tell you right now I did not get that coordinated. I was a very busy lady this year. So I don&#8217;t have a Matt on saxophone. Still, I did think that maybe it might be nice just for me to sing a teensy little Christmas carol for you all just because it seems especially poignant the words this year, especially after the 2020, 2021 COVID, all the things and trying to get back in person. So I&#8217;m going to sing you all one little verse from <em>Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>01:35 <em>Singing</em>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have yourself a merry little Christmas</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let your heart be light</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From now on our troubles</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will be out of sight</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have yourself a merry little Christmas</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make the Yuletide gay</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From now on our troubles</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will be miles away</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we are as in olden days</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy golden days of yore</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Faithful friends who are dear to us</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gather near to us, once more</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the years we all will be together</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the fates allow</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hang a shining star upon the highest bough</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And have yourself a merry little Christmas now</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we are as in olden days</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy golden days of yore</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Faithful friends who are dear to us</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gather near to us, once more</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the years we all will be together</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the fates allow</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hang a shining star upon the highest bough</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And have yourself a merry little Christmas now</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, my friends, that was from my heart to yours if you happened to listen. If you skipped a few seconds to get through it, which I would totally understand, that is also fine. But I did want to just kind of wrap up the year to let you all know that I am so incredibly grateful for all of the people who show up for the WordPress project to make it a success. I have made so many friends and wonderful acquaintances throughout my time here with the WordPress project. And especially in my three years as the project&#8217;s Executive Director. You all have put a lot of trust in me and a lot of faith. And I know that we have gotten so much done together in the last few years. And I am equally sure that we&#8217;re going to get so much done in the years to come. And so thank you all so much for your continued work with WordPress and the way that you just bring your best at all times. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One other little thanks I want to give. Over the course of this year, I&#8217;ve had an excellent team that works with me on this podcast. I have editing and design folks and people who&#8217;ve joined me here and there, folks who helped me with my production. So big thank you to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/dustinhartzler/\">Dustin</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/beafialho/\">Bea</a>, I realize your name is Beatriz in the actual credits, but I call you Bea, and so thank you. Also, a huge thank you to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\">Chloé</a>, who does all of our production and wrangling every couple of weeks. A big round of applause and kudos to that tiny but tough team that helps me get this all done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s to go on top of the general thanks to the WordPress project. And if you all are celebrators, I hope you have a wonderful holiday season. If you are not celebrators, I hope that you have a wonderful end to your year and that everything you wanted to get done, you did get done, and that you can start 2022 with a fresh slate. Again, this is the WP Briefing. Thank you so much for listening. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in 2022.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"11880\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38:\"Highlights from State of the Word 2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/12/highlights-from-state-of-the-word-2021/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 01:04:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"WrapUp\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=11869\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"Highlights and the official video for State of the Word 2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Anjana Vasan\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3653:\"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"632\" height=\"356\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OpiH_P9aGhQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>State of the Word 2021, the annual keynote from WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg, happened on December 14. The hybrid event took place in New York City with a small audience (proof of vaccination required). As Matt said, &#8220;we had people join by plane, train, and automobile.&#8221; Those who didn’t make the trek to the live event watched the livestream from wherever they call home, all around the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was an exciting moment for the WordPress community which also celebrated its first in-person WordCamp in Sevilla, Spain, after a lengthy hiatus for in-person events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2021/12/15/matt-mullenweg-2021-state-of-the-word/\">view the full recording</a>, complete with captions and transcripts on WordPress.tv.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was thrilling to see so many meetup organizers host watch parties worldwide. Twenty-eight watch parties were held across eleven countries, with more than 300 RSVPs.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to past State of the Word events, Matt covered a broad range of topics. This year was no different.

Read on for some highlights.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"full-site-editing\"><strong><strong>Full Site Editing</strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"styles-interface\">The <strong>Styles Interface</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Combine all the features that went live in 5.8 with those making their entrance in 5.9, and you get <strong>Full Site Editing.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Formerly known as Global Styles, the Styles Interface lets you interact directly with your blocks and elements right in the WordPress Admin. From typography to color palettes, this cohesive design interface means a design change—even a dramatic one—can happen without a theme switch. <strong>No code needed.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"theme-json\"><strong>Theme.json</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Introduced in WordPress 5.8, theme.json has been improved to enable features and default styles for your site and its blocks. With 5.9, theme.json can support child themes and the duotone treatment. Coordinate layers of style with theme.json, taking the weight off of your theme’s required CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other features supported by theme.json include: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Border:</strong> color, style, and width augment the border-radius property that landed in 5.8.</li><li><strong>Flex layouts:</strong> Block Gap support, courtesy of spacing.blockGap.</li><li><strong>Typography:</strong> font families, font style, font weight, text decoration, and text transform.</li><li><strong>Images</strong>: Duotones.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"a-new-navigation-block\"><strong>A New Navigation Block</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to the most intuitive way to build navigation: the Navigation Block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the features that need testing the most:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Responsive menu options you can turn off, have always on, or opt to use only for small screens.</li><li>Built-in keyboard accessibility.&nbsp; For accessibility, for speed, or both.</li><li>Add extra blocks like Search and Site Icon blocks (and customize them to your liking).</li><li>Submenu items with styling options.</li><li>Horizontal or vertical alignment.</li><li>Reusable navigation? Even across themes? Yes. Because the Navigation Block you build gets saved as a custom post type.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"a-better-gallery-block\"><strong>A Better Gallery Block</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you could treat single images in your Gallery Block the same way you treat the Image Block? <strong>Now you can.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p> Make every image in your gallery different from the next, with inline cropping or a duotone and change layouts with the ease of drag and drop. With the improved gallery block, every image is its own Image block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>One thing to note: </strong>Have you built a plugin or theme on the Gallery Block functionality?<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/08/20/gallery-block-refactor-dev-note/\"> Be sure to review this Dev Note, which details what you need to do for compatibility</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"focused-template-part-mode\"><strong>Focused Template Part Mode</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Building template parts can take a level of focus all its own because you’re making decisions for the entire site. So WordPress 5.9 adds a focus mode that shows you only the part you’re working on right now (and you can get back to the regular view with a keystroke).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"block-pattern-directory\"><strong>Block Pattern Directory</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/\">Pattern Directory</a> offers a range of prebuilt block patterns, from a couple of blocks that show an image and text, to an entire page layout with columns and sections. Since the 5.8 release, the directory has become a hub for exploratory UI and patterns, taking submissions and offering them to the community. So now, your creation can help other people build out their perfect site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"twenty-twenty-two-default-theme\"><strong>Twenty Twenty-Two Default Theme</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A whole new way of building WordPress themes.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.9 introduces features that make Full Site Editing possible, including <strong>the first default block theme</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using minimal CSS, theme styles reside in theme.json so that you can configure them in the Styles interface of the WordPress Admin. Make this theme take on its own personality site-wide, with a wide array of color schemes, type combinations, page templates, premade components (forms), and image treatments to choose from.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"more-improvements-and-updates\"><strong>More Improvements and Updates</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Do you love to blog? New tweaks to the publishing flow let you add new posts just seconds after hitting Publish on your latest post.</li><li>List View lets you drag and drop content as easily as you could always cruise through it – and collapse entire sections – so you can concentrate on a task or get the bigger picture.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/33955\">The Buttons and Social icons blocks now absorb</a> and display their parent block’s toolbar controls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43700\">Choose your language</a> on the login screen.</li><li>More <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/33868\">performance improvements</a> (i.e., speed).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Props to <a

Every event she attends is a further step on a journey of discovering the WordPress community and its many opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“It is not that hard to fall for WordPress if you have a chance to experience WordPress. For me, it took a WordCamp.”</p><cite>Devin Maeztri</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin&#8217;s first experience with camps came when she volunteered impromptu at an Indonesian event, WordCamp Denpasar, Bali in 2016.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, she made a profound discovery: “WordCamps can bring people who will give back to the community, even if they don’t get anything from WordPress directly.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With every WordCamp after that first experience, she became more interested in WordPress and the community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, Devin found she wanted to be part of WordPress events more often. She became a regular at Meetups in Ubud and Jakarta, joining as a co-organizer at WordCamp Jakarta in 2017 and 2019. Later, she took on the role of co-organizer for Meetups in Jakarta and Ubud.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smitten by what WordCamps can offer and how they can bring people together across national borders, she joined the organizing team for WordCamp Asia 2020. Sadly, this event was to become the first major WordPress event to be cancelled in the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, Devin hopes WordCamp Asia will happen someday very soon. Beyond the expected WordPress learning and sharing that event will promote, she believes its very scale will showcase how WordCamps add international tourism and cultural understanding everywhere they take place.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"632\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/wcasia_2020_organizers_in_wceu_2019.jpeg?resize=632%2C632&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Devin pictured with other WordCamp Asia organizers who attended WordCamp Europe in 2019\" class=\"wp-image-11692\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/wcasia_2020_organizers_in_wceu_2019.jpeg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/wcasia_2020_organizers_in_wceu_2019.jpeg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/wcasia_2020_organizers_in_wceu_2019.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/wcasia_2020_organizers_in_wceu_2019.jpeg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>WordCamp Asia 2020 Organizers at WordCamp Europe 2019.

How it changes the lives of so many people, how it helps dreams come true. It made me think, considering WordPress is that powerful, why are there not even more people in Indonesia using websites, and more using WordPress? Why aren’t more talented Indonesian WordPress users, developers, designers, and business owners taking part in WordPress.org projects? Language, for me, was the main answer.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The solution Devin felt was to make WordPress available in the main local language. She said: “I believe, the more content translated into Indonesian, the more Indonesian WordPress users see WordPress as more than just a blogging platform or a content management system. They will realize it’s a huge open source community that works together to make the web a better place. The more plugins and themes translated, the easier the work of the developer and designer will be. The more people see how WordPress can enhance their life, the better the ecosystem for business owners becomes.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"encouraging-others-to-translate-wordpress\">Encouraging others to translate WordPress</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After talking with others about how WordPress could be even more useful in Indonesia, Devin felt she had to make a personal commitment to reviving the polyglot project in Indonesia. With another volunteer contributor and through promotion, the local polyglot team got bigger and the interest in translation grew. She also took on the responsibility of a General Translation Editor for the language.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"318\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/featured-img-used-for-devin-pow2.jpg?resize=632%2C318&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Polyglot nominatee - Devin Maeztri\" class=\"wp-image-11706\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/featured-img-used-for-devin-pow2.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/featured-img-used-for-devin-pow2.jpg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/featured-img-used-for-devin-pow2.jpg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/featured-img-used-for-devin-pow2.jpg?w=1247&amp;ssl=1 1247w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the efforts of Devin and the other translation editors, Indonesia took part in <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">WordPress Translation Day</a> in 2020, and in 2021 held sprints and learning sessions spanning the whole 30 days of the event. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her enthusiasm and dedication to helping others translate WordPress locally and promoting the global community were recognized in the Polyglot Appreciation Nominations for 2021. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"helping-to-give-access-to-more-diverse-audiences\">Helping to give access to more diverse audiences</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Through her involvement in translation, Devin noticed there were not many women involved in the WordPress community in Indonesia. Often, she found herself the only woman at an event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, along with a couple of community members, she started Perempuan WordPress, a local initiative. This group is open for everyone to join, but prioritizes women as event speakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin has gone on to support the work of the Diversity Speaker Training group in the Community Team, translating materials and promoting initiatives in Indonesia.&nbsp;She is keen to encourage others to get involved with this initiative which helps increase the diversity of presenters at Meetups and WordCamps. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/devin-at-wc-jakarta2019.png?resize=600%2C534&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11689\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/devin-at-wc-jakarta2019.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/devin-at-wc-jakarta2019.png?resize=300%2C267&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><em>Organizing at WordCamp Jakarta 2019</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In her professional roles, Devin is an advocate for WordPress as a tool for people with a wide variety of skill sets. She does not code, but uses the platform extensively for her projects. In 2014, she signed up for a free account on WordPress.com to keep and share notes about what she saw or was thinking about as she commuted on public transport to work. This site did not turn into a blog, but instead introduced her to other opportunities and the vast capabilities of the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"wordpress-can-support-your-skills-and-passions\">WordPress can support your skills and passions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With a background in environmental activism, Devin has worked for international development organizations on everything from policymaking to campaigning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind the desk, she worked with policymakers and organized conferences and meetings. That meant doing a lot of writing and translating and working with people on the ground who were impacted by the policies. “My work on the ground usually involved researching, movement building and community empowerment,” she noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her work with events inspired Devin to get involved in WordCamps and Meetups and share her energy for making things happen. As in her professional work, she felt WordPress was an opportunity to work and share with people about something that can make a positive impact on someone else’s life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“For me, everything comes from the heart. I do things that I feel so strongly about. Things that call me, and things that I am good at but still giving me room to learn and become better at. WordPress can be the perfect place for this.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While she was between jobs, Devin was encouraged to volunteer at WordCamp Denpasar 2016. With some help, she created an online CV. She also learned to manage a WordPress site, navigate the wp-admin, and make the content appeal to potential employers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She eventually got a job as a campaigner to build a movement online and offline. The brainchild of many university friends in America, who used digital campaigns to go global, the campaign used WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin worked alongside a digital campaigner and helped shape the content, the call to action, and the user experience. She also had to use the wp-admin to make some amendments. As a global movement, it developed its resources in English, so she also reviewed the work of the translators she worked with.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"474\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/cat-watching-translation.jpg?resize=632%2C474&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"One of Devin\'s cats watches the WPTranslationDay 2021 livestreamed events.\" class=\"wp-image-11688\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/cat-watching-translation-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/cat-watching-translation-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/cat-watching-translation-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/cat-watching-translation-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/cat-watching-translation-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/cat-watching-translation-scaled.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/cat-watching-translation-scaled.jpg?w=1896&amp;ssl=1 1896w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Devin&#8217;s cat became a regular on social media posts about #WPTranslationDay 2021</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>She left her job as a campaigner at the end of 2018 to concentrate on freelancing – and to spend more of her free time contributing to the WordPress community. She also took up the initiative to help street cats in Jakarta.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin said: “So, I am busy helping these cats but also learning how to fundraise using a website. I’m learning to use online forms, set up a payment service provider, work on SEO, and do other new things I need to learn to grow my initiative. I do have the privilege to learn directly from a personal guru. The same person who convinced me to volunteer at WordCamp Denpasar, and who I married in 2018.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"wordpress-gives-everyone-a-chance-to-learn\">WordPress gives everyone a chance to learn</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin was so enthused by being a contributor for WordPress, she took part in the video shorts following the Translation Day events.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"632\" height=\"356\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VsiQzdmAz8g?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe>\n</div><figcaption>Devin talks about translating in this short <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsiQzdmAz8g\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> (opens in a new tab on YouTube)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>She is also active in other Contributor Teams and decided to become a Community Team Deputy to support meetups in new cities across Indonesia and perhaps future WordCamps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “One of the things that I like about WordPress is that it is very welcoming and open to people like me, who don’t code at all. At the same time, it shows me a different way of looking at the world.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin believes in the power of WordPress to give ‘everyone a chance to learn new things’ and allows her to contribute and share her knowledge and experience. “By contributing, I hope to make a difference in someone’s life. I hope they feel the benefit of using WordPress and want to give back to create a healthier WordPress community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"contributors\">Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">@</a><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">webcommsat</a>) and Mary Baum (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a>) for the interviews and writing this feature, and to Devin Maeztri (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/devinmaeztri/\">@devinmaeztri</a>) for sharing her story.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. See, here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, today, folks, in our podcast, I am joined by a couple of special guests. I know it&#8217;s been a bit since I&#8217;ve had a guest, so I&#8217;m very excited to introduce you to who I have with me today. Today, I have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/onemaggie/\">Maggie Cabrera</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jffng/\">Jeff Ong</a>. They both are working on themes, and especially the future of themes as we move into this low code, no code block based experience of editing things in WordPress. And there have been so many questions lately about what does the landscape of being a theme developer turns into once we move fully into this excellent promise of user empowerment for Gutenberg? I figured who best to come and talk to us about that than these two. So welcome, Maggie. Welcome, Jeff. I&#8217;m really excited to have this conversation with you today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>01:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for having us. Excited to be here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m just gonna hop right in, and we will see what happens. The first thing that I want to chat about, I hear so many questions and so much discussion about patterns in a lot of different places. Like obviously, the work that I helped to steward the most is around like the Block Pattern directory and various other user-facing tools. And so I have never really been able to give a really solid answer about like patterns and how they work inside themes. And so I wondered if you all had anything that you could offer to our listeners to help clarify what is the power of patterns inside themes in the future? Implementation of themes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>02:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can try to start unless, Maggie? Okay. Well, if you take a look at what I&#8217;ve been doing for the last couple of months working on Twenty Twenty-Two. And if you look at that theme, it&#8217;s mostly just the collection of patterns. Patterns. As you know, if you read the description, the theme, it&#8217;s designed to be the most flexible and kind of like flexible theme ever, dare I say ever created.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think you can dare to say it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>03:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, you know, I think a huge part of that is because of the Full Site Editing being launched, introduced in 5.9. And also that theme itself ships with all of these patterns in it that work with the overall design, but really can be configured to your own kind of unique liking and kind of taste and ultimately, what you want to accomplish, whether that&#8217;s I want to make a portfolio, I want to make, you know, a single-page website promoting like my podcast, or there are patterns for that kind of shipping with the theme. And they&#8217;ve all been kind of designed and tailored to work with the typography choices at a baseline level with the color choices at a baseline level, but can very easily be tweaked. And you can kind of rely on them to work with the editor. And I guess, kind of zooming out for a little bit, not just about Twenty-Twenty Two.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>04:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like patterns as this idea that a theme, hopefully, what it is, it&#8217;s a collection of different design options or layout options that are ultimately presented as patterns to the user, the patterns are just a really easy way to basically say &#8220;I want you this layout, like two columns of text or with like some images here.&#8221; Basically, a theme becomes a way of packaging the patterns together in a way that feels like a coherent piece of a coherent website. And I think that&#8217;s a pretty powerful idea. I know that the patterns directory is also opening up making those patterns pretty widely available. But I think a theme you could think of as like a curation of those patterns in a way that makes sense. And I think Twenty-Twenty Two is a really good example. I mean, I&#8217;m biased.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also think it&#8217;s a good example. Maggie, did you have anything that you wanted to add to that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maggie Cabrera&nbsp; </strong>05:08</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, What I really like about patterns is how it empowers the user, even if they don&#8217;t really have like a deep knowledge of code, or they&#8217;re not used to the more complex blocks. When the theme developer gives you this pattern about using the query block, for example, it lays out your posts in a very compelling manner. And you can edit it if you want it or just use it out of the box. And you have this dynamic blog that it&#8217;s, like, such a big important part of your website. Like if you want to have a page where you have, you have maybe a podcast website, and you want to showcase your podcasts differently than your regular blog posts. So you can use a different gray pattern for that. And it&#8217;s like, really, really easy to use, even if you&#8217;re not familiar with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I have found compelling about this new version of themes and kind of the way that themes are planning to look in the future; it&#8217;s going to be like a super throwback, so everyone get ready for me to sound old, my guests and my listeners alike. It reminds me of my original days of blogging on the web. I was not a developer and even though I had this really short stint of working with JavaScript in my career, at some point. Like no one actually would ever look to me and be like, that one is excellent at design and fixing everything with code, like I was just killer at searching for the right pieces of code, right.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I remember sitting there on Zynga, which is, of course, now powered by WordPress, I absolutely just went out and found bundles of code that are now what we would consider themes and modified the small pieces that I needed to change in order to like really suit what I wanted to have happen on the site at the time. And they&#8217;re like, I knew I could break it all. Really easily. But also, it was, it was not scary to think about breaking it. Like it was clear how I could fix it if I really broke it. The content, like what I had written, was separate from everything to do with the way that it was looking. And so like, I wouldn&#8217;t destroy all of my work, just because I didn&#8217;t put a semicolon in the right place, or whatever it was in that moment. And so like, this future of themes really reminds me of this a lot where someone has curated how it can look how it should look. And you can just like add in modular pieces that will augment what was already intended, but still kind of work. And if it&#8217;s not gonna work, it&#8217;s kind of easy to fix too. So like, I&#8217;m excited. That was a really exciting time in my learning of the web and certainly was formative in my career, as we all now see. And so yeah, I think that&#8217;s really exciting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did have actually another question that this conversation has kind of brought up for me. I have, obviously just use the term modular, which no one has ever used in the context of themes for WordPress. And I know that there is a lot there are a lot of terms kind of wandering around about themes right now. And especially as we&#8217;re moving into what themes can look like in the future. There was block based theme as a term for a while. And now it&#8217;s block themes. There was like this floating around the term, universal themes. And now we&#8217;re looking at just like block themes forever. And so I wondered if y&#8217;all could give us a just like a clear understanding of these terms that had been being used and maybe are going out of fashion? Like, are they important for us to keep knowing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>09:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, the history of terms around themes. And obviously, even my knowledge only goes back so far. But it was around when we started doing the block based themes meeting. And trying to I think that&#8217;s where that term kind of came from is like, oh, let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s start talking about this idea that themes can be completely made up out of blocks. And what does that mean?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>09:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think over time, it wasn&#8217;t just block themes, because, you know, previously, there were themes and even default themes that used and took into account the fact that blocks existed. So there was some confusion there. Enough time has gone on where we focus on this idea that themes whose templates are ultimately made out of blocks are block themes. And to me, it&#8217;s kind of as simple as that. Its themes that supply a set of templates that previously in the past were a collection of PHP and various template tags and whatnot is all transitioned to themes made up including other blocks, as well as themes that supply styles through theme.json configuration instead of supplying it in raw CSS. To me this idea is really crystallizing around like this is a block theme, one that is really, at its core, supplying a set of templates, and styles through a language that WordPress understands natively, and can allow it to be configured and customized in a really powerful way. And then maybe someday in the future, they&#8217;ll just be called themes again. If we do a good enough they will just be called themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m gonna, I&#8217;m gonna take us into a philosophical area now that you&#8217;ve just put us in there. You said, someday they&#8217;ll be called Themes. Again, I&#8217;ve talked about this on this podcast a few times. And for anyone who&#8217;s worked with me for any length of time, like you all probably heard this from me as well. But like, adjectives are so frequently the realm of things that are not what you expect, right? Because like you have coffee, and then decaf coffee, no one&#8217;s like caffeinated coffee, because that&#8217;s what you expect out of it. And so when you&#8217;re like themes, and block themes, it makes it look like block themes are secondary, which at the moment, they are, ish. But in the future, I think you&#8217;re probably right, there will be a time when the modifier isn&#8217;t necessary anymore because it will be hopefully a much better way for people to kind of change the way that their themes work and make it more usable for users and people who are, you know, having to manage their own site without necessarily wanting to or being able to, like, have a Maggie in the room to fix everything that they break.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:08</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maggie is nowhere near me. And so she&#8217;s never been in the room when I&#8217;ve broken anything. But I believe that Maggie on one occasion, at least, has come in and helped me fix something that I definitely broke. I&#8217;m an excellent breaker of WordPress things. Maggie, did you have anything you wanted to add to that question?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>12:29</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I guess, maybe clarify a bit, what universal themes are because, yeah, maybe some people have heard about the term but they don&#8217;t really know what they are. And maybe just clarify that. The term was born when developing block themes wasn&#8217;t something that you could actually do for production websites like you could build them to test some experiments, but they weren&#8217;t really ready for users to use. So universal themes want to grasp the power of love themes while still being ready for users. So the way they do it is they are block based, like we used to call them in the sense that the templates are made of blocks. But they are also able to be customized using the customizer, which is the old way of customizing themes, instead of using the site editor. So they can have a balance between two worlds between the worlds of classic themes and block themes. But they are, at heart, a temporary concept. They are bound to be blocked themes in the future, but with maybe a foot in the past, where they can actually serve users who are not ready for full-on site editor. But they are bound to be full block themes in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>14:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a really interesting concept in there. So universal themes, it sounds like are basically kind of like an on-ramp for people who are not really ready to fully commit to this for any number of reasons. Like we never want to say that we know the reason that people would be a little bit shy to get started with this. But like it&#8217;s kind of like an on-ramp, it&#8217;s a safe way to get back to something that they do know, in the event that what they don&#8217;t know, really hinders their progress makes it hard for them to get the work done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maggie Cabrera&nbsp; </strong>14:31</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I wouldn&#8217;t say that they are for people shyer to get into new stuff rather than developers who want to embrace the new stuff before it&#8217;s even really ready. They really want to embrace the power of the blocks instead of doing things the old way. But even if it&#8217;s not fully ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>14:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They still need to support the old way of doing things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maggie Cabrera&nbsp; </strong>14:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like being backward compatible and being ready for any kind of user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>15:05</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So mostly for developers, everyone who heard me just talking about how it was a great thing for users, ignore it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maggie Cabrera&nbsp; </strong>15:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also good for users; If they feel secure in using the customizer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>15:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I think that there&#8217;s something important here that we certainly learned with the adoption of Gutenberg in 5.0. Right, which is that there is certainly one method of helping people to adopt things, which is to go like the art of war style, and kind of smash their rice pots and burn all their boats, like, that&#8217;s one way. Which works for a lot of companies in the world, I&#8217;m sure. But WordPress has always had kind of a commitment, not even kind of, has always had a commitment to backward compatibility. And like, we know that a lot of the work on Gutenberg is going to represent some breaking changes around the around workflows and around the user experience the interface, especially like, we know that. But the opportunity to like have a thing that gives you an early taste of what&#8217;s coming but also the ability to keep kind of working in your old space where you need to, I think it&#8217;s an excellent way to bring people forward into the future of things, I have never been a fan of the just like cut off all avenues and hope that they stay with your method because of course, like you can&#8217;t cut off all the methods. You can&#8217;t cut off all the ways people can get away from you. And even if we could, it wouldn&#8217;t be in line with how WordPress hopes to kind of help people through some tough stuff like making your first website is hard. If you are doing it as part of, an overall campaign that&#8217;s supposed to bring in leads for you or generate revenue like you don&#8217;t want to necessarily play with that in a way that could break things and be risky for you in the long term. So I think all the tools that we offer to help people kind of move forward with the technology move forward with the CMS as it&#8217;s moving forward, I think it&#8217;s really smart. And so universal themes are one of those things, but also not around to stay. As we move into non modified themes, just the word themes that happen to be based in blocks. If I&#8217;ve confused anyone, please email me at wpbriefing@wordpress.org. And tell me how I confused you. And I will do a follow-up to unconfuse everyone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>17:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So speaking of the way that we help people kind of move forward with WordPress and with the technology. So much has been done in the CMS in the past 12 months in the past 18 months to be able to move themes into this same future as the rest of the editor. Right. So like, for folks who have not been listening to me for the last five years, you may not know this. So I&#8217;m going to tell everybody now, like one of the pain points that Gutenberg overall is solving is the fact that you for a long time had to learn five different editing interfaces to get one thing done in WordPress, right. And so like the advent of blocks and moving it into more and more spaces in the CMS is intended to really flatten the editing experience by making the type of user interaction the type of workflow really similar across all of the editing interfaces in the CMS. And so themes are a natural extension of that, where we can take similar user patterns and workflows, and work them out into themes. So over the last 12 months or so probably a little bit more, there&#8217;s been a lot of work on the CMS to move us forward in that that is now enabling the work that we want to be able to do to move things forward ahead. And so, I mean, this is probably our last question. Is there anything that you all want to offer to people who maybe saw themes early on or saw Gutenberg early on and felt like this is just not for me, in that in that context of like, how far it&#8217;s moved ahead in the past 12 months or so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>19:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you&#8217;re asking like, what in the last 12 months has maybe like really surprised me or like sticks out to me as something that like, Wow, look how far we&#8217;ve come?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>19:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, yeah. So like, if you&#8217;re looking at what is the one thing that you saw in the last 12 months, that changed in the CMS that really enabled something wonderful for themes or from the other side of it. Like if someone had looked at themes or WordPress 18 months ago, and now they&#8217;re looking at it and seeing this new and different way to do things with the look and feel of their site, like what is one thing that they should be aware of? On either side of that question,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maggie Cabrera&nbsp; </strong>20:05</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there&#8217;s more than one thing that has really evolved through this last year, year and a half. Like the maturity of some of the blocks is astounding now, like navigation blog, for example, was really bare-bones at the start and now it&#8217;s full potential, and it&#8217;s really looking really great. I would say the same thing about those days or the features on fire, like how basic it was at the start, was full potential. But now it&#8217;s really, really mature in terms of how much you can do with it. Like, I think the example, the perfect example of that is the work that <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/kjellr/\">Kjell [Reigstad]</a> has done on Twenty-Twenty Two with the alternative theme.json files, where just changing that file basically feels like a new theme, with just the configuration and the styles. And without writing any CSS without changing any templates. It&#8217;s really, really amazing how that can turn into a reality. And it&#8217;s so easy for users to tinker with that if they want to. And it&#8217;s much easier than having to delve deep into CSS and changing everything in like 2000 lines of code.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>21:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I probably would echo most of that. What the thing that astounds me is global styles and how the UI can be shipping a theme or default theme with basically like, 20 lines of CSS, and have it be one of them. A beautiful, beautiful, like crisp and sharp, like, experience. It&#8217;s super fast. And it&#8217;s like, what this is a theme, you know, I thought a theme was supposed to supply all the styles like no, like, it&#8217;s just yeah. And workers do for you. Exactly. And like that. That&#8217;s pretty amazing to think in the last 12 months, we can go from, you know, shipping 1000s of lines of CSS to you none, it&#8217;s like, Wow, pretty cool.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>22:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, my friends, thank you so much for joining me today. This has been a really interesting conversation. I hope that all y&#8217;all out listening. Also find it interesting. As I mentioned, if you have any follow-up questions, absolutely. Send them to me via email. And I collect all of my questions that I get through the year for answering at the end of the year, mostly because I don&#8217;t get lots of questions that people want to be answered on this. Everyone just asked me their questions on Twitter and in Slack, which is fine as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>22:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Maggie, Jeff, thank you both for joining me. And I&#8217;m sure that we&#8217;ll talk to you all again soon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>22:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. In the last episode, I got all excited about being in the beta phase. But today, I&#8217;m rolling that back a little bit. As part of our usual open source processes, a group of contributors did a deep dive review on the WordPress 5.9 release and found a workflow that needed some refinement. So we are delaying the beta.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>23:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we are in the midst of a major commerce slash/sales season, and of course, a lengthy holiday season, that delay also means that it makes sense to delay WordPress 5.9 final release a little as well. And so we are delaying that all the way into 2022 to January 25. For me, the trade-off works really well there. Every decision that we make in open source, of course, has some balance to it. It&#8217;s great for these aspects, it is less great for these aspects over here. But for myself, the opportunity to make sure that we have a really excellent experience for our users and also an opportunity to kind of avoid all of the chaos and hustle and bustle of the end of the year. Really, it seemed like a no-brainer for me. So in case you want to learn a little bit more about why we made the decision and get some insight into the actual milestones and where they have moved now, I&#8217;ll include some posts in the show notes below in case you want to read more and of course, if you have any additional questions you can always ask.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>24:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second small list of big things is that the first back to people WordCamp. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re calling it. Our first back to people WordCamp is happening in a couple of weeks actually. WordCamp Sevilla is happening in person on December 11. And I&#8217;m so excited I wish I were local, but I&#8217;m not so if you are local stop by their website and pick up your ticket.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>24:55</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing on our smallest a big things is that it is, of course, charitable giving season. I don&#8217;t know if you do your charitable giving at the end of the year or if that&#8217;s even part of your general ways of giving back. But I can think of two or three charitable organizations inside the WordPress ecosystem. There&#8217;s of course the WordPress Foundation, but also Big Orange Heart and HeroPress. If there are others out there, I certainly do want to know about them. WordPress Foundation also does additional giving on behalf of just like the open web and open source as a whole. So if you&#8217;re the sort of person who does their charitable giving at the end of the year, just a reminder that you have some options inside the WordPress ecosystem if you were trying to figure out some new places to donate to in 2021.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>25:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is your small list of big things. Thank you so much for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. Thank you again to our special guests, Maggie and Jeff. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"11636\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"Watch State of the Word at a Watch Party with your WordPress Friends\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/11/watch-state-of-the-word-at-a-watch-party-with-your-wordpress-friends/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 18:30:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=11641\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:322:\"State of the Word 2021 is just around the corner!&#160; Although attending State of the Word in person would be ideal, not all WordPress community members get to enjoy the experience of attending the speech live with friends.&#160; This year, as State of the Word is streamed live for the second time, we want to [&#8230;]\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Hari Shanker R\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20064:\"\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/11/state-of-the-word-2021/\">State of the Word 2021</a> is just around the corner!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although attending State of the Word in person would be ideal, not all WordPress community members get to enjoy the experience of attending the speech live with friends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, as State of the Word is streamed live for the second time, we want to restore that in person camaraderie through State of the Word watch parties for WordPress Community members around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>We encourage WordPress meetup organizers and community members worldwide to (safely) host State of the Word 2021 watch parties —</strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/2021-state-of-the-word-watch-parties/\"><strong>read this handbook to learn more</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"why-organize-a-watch-party\">Why organize a watch party?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If you are a <a href=\"https://meetup.com/pro/wordpress\">WordPress meetup</a> organizer, many folks in your meetup may be unaware of the State of the Word, and a watch party could be a great opportunity to introduce or remind them.</li><li>As meetup organizers slowly bid goodbye to a tough year, the watch party could be an excellent opportunity to revitalize your group, especially if you haven’t had many events this year.</li><li>Along with your Meetup group members, you get a platform to ask questions directly to Matt Mullenweg.</li><li>And last but not least, even if you are not a Meetup Organizer, a watch party can be the perfect opportunity to reconnect and have a blast with your WordPress friends!</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-organize-a-state-of-the-word-watch-party\">How do I organize a State of the Word watch party?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can choose to host a watch party online or in person.
